<p>In this series of lessons, we’re going to introduce how to “scrape” data from the internet with the Python libraries requests and BeautifulSoup.</p>
<p>We will cover how to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Programmatically access the text of a web page</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the basics of HTML</p></li>
<li><p>Extract certain HTML elements</p></li>

<h2>Why Do We Need To Scrape At All?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-do-we-need-to-scrape-at-all" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>To understand the significance of web scraping, let’s walk through the likely data collection process behind <a class="reference external" href="https://pudding.cool/2017/03/film-dialogue/">“Film Dialogue from 2,000 screenplays, Broken Down by Gender and Age”</a>.</p>
<p>To find their 2,000 screenplays, Hannah Andersen and Matt Daniels consulted a number of already existing sources — one of which was the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html">Cornell Movie Dialogues Corpus</a>. This is a corpus created by Cornell CIS professors Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lillian Lee for their paper <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/papers/chameleons.pdf">“Chameleons in imagined conversations”</a>. Go Big Red!</p>
<p>These researchers helpfully shared a dataset of every URL that they used to find and access the screenplays in their own project.</p>

<p>Each movie title in this CSV file is paired with a URL for the screenplay. How can we actually use these URLs to get computationally tractable text data?</p>
<p>Though we could manually navigate to each URL and copy/paste each screenplay into a file, that would be suuuuper slow and painstaking, and we would lose crucial data in the process — information that might help us automatically distinguish the title of the movie from the screenplay itself, for example. It would be much better to programmatically access the text data attached to every URL.</p>

<section id="responses-and-requests">
<h2>Responses and Requests<a class="headerlink" href="#responses-and-requests" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>To programmatically access the text data attached to every URL, we can use a Python library called <a class="reference external" href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/">requests</a>.</p>
<p>When you type in a URL in your search address bar, you’re sending an HTTP <strong>request</strong> for a web page, and the server which stores that web page will accordingly send back a <strong>response</strong>, some web page data that your browser will render.</p>

					Final Shooting Script
				Last revised October 7, 1983


											FADE IN

EXT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY -- DAY

The sun shines brightly on the classic facade of the main library at Fifth
Avenue and 42nd Street.  In the adjacent park area, pretty hustlers and
drug peddlers go about their business.

FRONT STEPS

A few people lounge on the steps flanked by the familiar stone lions.

INT. MAIN READING ROOM -- DAY

People are dotted throughout the room sitting at the long oak tables
polished by decades of use.  Reading lamps with green glass shades cast a
golden glow on the tables.  The patina of age is everywhere.  It is very
quiet.

LIBRARIAN

A slightly stout, studious looking girl in her late twenties circulates
quietly among the tables picking up books and putting them on her cart.
Everything seems completely normal and peaceful.

POV

A single eerie musical note signals the presence of something strange
looking down on the Librarian from a vantage point high above the room.
It follows the Librarian as she pushes her cart around the corner.

INT. WORK AREA

The Librarian is alone in a back room sorting books for reshelving.
Behind her is the card catalogue.  One of the books attracts her interest
and she starts leafing through it.

THE CARD CATALOGUE

Another eerie note is heard as one of the drawers silently slides open
behind the Librarian and hundreds of index cards start popping out.  The
Librarian continues reading completely oblivious to this strange
phenomenon.

She gets up and moves past another row of cabinets.  Two more drawers
quietly slide open, and thousands of file cards start shooting out of the
open drawers just behind her, but the Librarian still doesn&#39;t notice.

THE STACKS

The Librarian works her way through rows and rows of old iron shelves
containing many thousands of volumes stacked from floor to ceiling.  As
she puts the books back in their proper places, she slowly gets the
feeling that she&#39;s being watched.  She continues her task but suddenly
hears a scratching noise and stops.

						LIBRARIAN
				(puzzled)
			Hello?  Is anybody there?

A ROW OF BOOKS

As the Librarian walks down the aisle, books start shooting off the shelf
behind her.  She turns suddenly and sees the fallen books.

THE LIBRARIAN

Frightened now, she walks slowly to the end of the aisle and tentatively
peeks around the corner.  Seeing no one, she starts to scratch her head
and suddenly a dozen books fly off the shelf right in front of her and
fall to the floor.

						LIBRARIAN
				(frightened)
			All right!  Who&#39;s there?  Lyle? Is that you?

Very slowly now, her heart pounding, the Librarian tiptoes to the other
end of the aisle.  She gets to the corner and starts to peek around it,
afraid to look but unable to resist.

INT. THE NEXT AISLE -- DAY

The Librarian comes slowly around the end of the stacks and gets her first
look at the thing that&#39;s been watching her.  Her eyes go very wide and her
mouth opens in horror. She screams.

EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY -- DAY

Students are entering and leaving a neo-Gothic building on the
University&#39;s upper west side campus.  A sign identifies the building as:
Weaver Hall -- Department of Psychology.

INT. BASEMENT -- WEAVER HALL -- DAY

At one end of the dingy corridor is a door marked PARANORMAL STUDIES
LABORATORY.  A sign dangles from the doorknob: Maid -- Please Make Up This
Room.  Scrawled across the door is a line of student graffiti that reads:
&quot;Venkman Burn In Hell!&quot;  It looks like it&#39;s been written in blood.

						VENKMAN (V.O.)
			Now I&#39;m going to turn over the next card and
			I want you to concentrate and tell me what
			you think it is.

INT. PARANORMAL STUDIES LAB -- SAME TIME - DAY

DR. PETER VENKMAN is administering an ESP test to two student volunteers,
a boy and a girl, who sit across the table from him separated from each
other by a screen.

Venkman is an associate professor but his rumpled suit and the manic gleam
in his eyes indicate an underlying instability in his nature.  However,
while a little short on academic credentials, Venkman is long on
confidence, charm and salesmanship.

He turns to the male volunteer, an obnoxious SOPHOMORE, and pulls out a
card from the standard deck of ESP symbols.  The card is visible to the
camera over Venkman&#39;s shoulder but hidden from the sophomore by a masonite
board that rests between them on the table.  The card shows a star symbol
on it.

						VENKMAN
			All right.  What is it?

						SOPHOMORE
				(concentrates)
			A square?

						VENKMAN
				(shakes his head)
			Good guess -- but no.

He shows the Sophomore the star card then presses a button on the table
which administers a mild electric shock to the volunteer.  The Sophomore
twitches involuntarily as the shock passes through the electrode attached
to his fingertips.  Then Venkman turns to the female volunteer, a very
beautiful COED.

						VENKMAN
			Now just clear your mind and tell me what
			you see.

He turns over a card with a circle on it.

						COED
				(thinks hard)
			Is it a star?

						VENKMAN
				(feigning surprise)
			It is a star!  That&#39;s great.  You&#39;re very
			good.

The Coed beams proudly as Venkman turns back to the Sophomore without
showing her the card.

						VENKMAN
				(to the Sophomore)
			Now think.

He turns up the diamond card.

The Sophomore glances nervously at the electrodes, then ventures a guess.

						SOPHOMORE
			Circle?

						VENKMAN
			Close -- but definitely wrong.

He shocks him again and swivels around to face the Coed.

						VENKMAN (CONT&#39;D)
			Ready?
				(she nods and he turns up
				the triangle card)
			What is it?

						COED
				(biting her lip)
			Ummm -- figure eight?

						VENKMAN
				(lies)
			Incredible!  Five for five.  You&#39;re not
			cheating on me here, are you?

						COED
				(amazed at her own ability)
			No.  They&#39;re just coming to me.

						VENKMAN
			Well, you&#39;re doing great.  Keep it up.

He turns back to the Sophomore who winces as the next card is turned
up -- two parallel wavy lines.

						VENKMAN (CONT&#39;D)
			Nervous?

						SOPHOMORE
			Yes.  I don&#39;t like this.

						VENKMAN
			Well, just 75 more to go.  What&#39;s this one?

						SOPHOMORE
				(takes a deep breath)
			Two wavy lines?

						VENKMAN
				(burying the card)
			Sorry.  This isn&#39;t your day.

He zaps him again but this time the Sophomore really jumps.

						SOPHOMORE
				(angry)
			Hey!  I&#39;m getting a little tired of this.

						VENKMAN
			You volunteered, didn&#39;t you?  Aren&#39;t we
			paying you for this?

						SOPHOMORE
			Yeah, but I didn&#39;t know you were going to
			give me electric shocks.  What are you
			trying to prove?

						VENKMAN
			I&#39;m studying the effect of negative
			reinforcement on ESP ability.

						SOPHOMORE
			I&#39;ll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!

						VENKMAN
			Then my theory was correct.

The Sophomore gets up, pulls the electrodes off his fingertips and exits.

						SOPHOMORE
				(as he goes)
			Keep the five bucks.  I&#39;ve had it!

Venkman turns back to the Coed and shrugs.

						VENKMAN
			Well, I guess some people have it and some
			don&#39;t.

						COED
				(provocatively)
			Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?

						VENKMAN
			Definitely.  I think you may be a very
			gifted telepath.

Suddenly the door opens and RAY STANTZ enters.

STANTZ

He is Venkman&#39;s colleague and best friend.  A hard scientist with a good
academic background, Stantz is a maverick who genuinely loves a challenge.
At the moment, he seems really keyed up.

						STANTZ
			Drop everything, Venkman.  We got one.

He starts rummaging through cabinets and drawers, gathering up a variety
of electronic devices.

VENKMAN

He frowns at the intrusion and turns to the Coed.

						VENKMAN
			Excuse me for a minute.
				(he crosses to Stantz)
			Ray, I&#39;m right in the middle of something
			here.  Can you come back in about an hour?

						STANTZ
				(excited, but hushed and
				confidential)
			Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main
			branch of the New York Public Library on
			Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a
			free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso
			apparition.  It blew books from shelves at
			twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some
			poor librarian.

						VENKMAN
				(unimpressed)
			Sure.  That&#39;s great, Ray.  I think you
			should get down there right away and check
			it out.  Let me know what happens.

						STANTZ
				(insistent)
			No, this one&#39;s for real, Peter.  Spengler
			went down there and took some PKE readings.
			Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the
			needle.  We&#39;re close this time. I can feel
			it.

Venkman looks at Stantz, then back at the Coed, torn between duty and
pleasure.

						VENKMAN
				(decides)
			Okay.  Just give me a second here.
				(he crosses back to the
				Coed)
			I have to leave now but if you&#39;ve got some
			time I&#39;d like you to come back this evening
			and do some more work with me.

						COED
			Eight o&#39;clock?

						VENKMAN
				(lying again)
			I was just going to say &quot;eight.&quot;  You&#39;re
			fantastic!

He waves good-bye and exits with Stantz.

EXT. PUBLIC LIBRARY -- DAY

Venkman and Stantz arrive in a taxi and trot up the front steps.  Stantz
is loaded down with equipment.

						STANTZ
			Spengler and I have charted every psychic
			occurrence in the Tri-State area for the
			past two years.  The graph we came up with
			definitely points to something big.

						VENKMAN
			Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I
			think you&#39;ve really gone around the bend on
			this ghost stuff.  You&#39;ve been running your
			ass off for two years checking out every
			schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he&#39;s
			had an experience.  And what have you seen?

						STANTZ
			What do you mean by &quot;seen?&quot;

						VENKMAN
			Looked at with your eyes.

						STANTZ
			Well, I was at an unexplained multiple
			high-altitude rockfall once.

						VENKMAN
			Uh-huh.  I&#39;ve heard about the rockfall, Ray.
			I think you&#39;ve been spending too much time
			with Spengler.

INT. MAIN READING ROOM -- DAY

EGON SPENGLER is looking for spirits when Venkman and Stantz arrive.
Spengler is a real egghead, a New Wave Mr. Spock, who single-handedly got
Venkman through graduate school.  Spengler is incredibly intelligent but
amazingly dense at the same time.  At the moment he is listening to a
table using a stethoscope connected to stereo earphones.  Venkman comes up
behind him and taps on the table to get his attention.

						VENKMAN
			Egon?

Spengler hears the tapping and thinks he&#39;s made contact with the spirit
world.  Then Venkman slams a heavy book down on the table.

						VENKMAN (CONT&#39;D)
			Egon!

Spengler jumps at the deafening noise in his earphones and turns to see
Venkman and Stantz.

						SPENGLER
			Oh!  You&#39;re here.

						VENKMAN
			What have you got, Egon?

						SPENGLER
			Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big.
			There&#39;s definitely something here.

						VENKMAN
			Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time
			you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do
			you remember that?

HEAD LIBRARIAN

A choleric, middle-aged civil servant, MR. DELACORTE, hurries over to meet
them.

						HEAD LIBRARIAN
				(nervous)
			Hello, I&#39;m Roger Delacorte - the Head
			Librarian.  Are you the men from the
			University?

						VENKMAN
			Yes.  I&#39;m Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.

						HEAD LIBRARIAN
				(leads them off)
			Thank you for coming.  I&#39;d appreciate it if
			we could take care of this quickly and quietly.

						VENKMAN
			One thing at a time.  We don&#39;t even know
			what it is yet.

INT. AN OFFICE -- A LITTLE LATER

Venkman is questioning the plump Librarian who saw the spirit, while a
Paramedic continues treating her for shock.

						LIBRARIAN
			I don&#39;t remember seeing any legs, but it
			definitely had arms because it reached for
			me.

						STANTZ
				(excited)
			Arms!  Great!  I can&#39;t wait to get a look
			at this thing.

Venkman glowers at him, still skeptical.

						VENKMAN
				(to the girl)
			All right, miss.  Have you or has any member
			of your family ever been diagnosed
			schizophrenic or mentally incompetent?

						LIBRARIAN
			Well, my uncle thought he was St. Jerome.

						VENKMAN
				(looks at Stantz)
			I&#39;ll call that a big &quot;yes.&quot;
				(to the girl)
			Do you yourself habitually use drugs,
			stimulants or alcohol?

						LIBRARIAN
			No.

						VENKMAN
			I thought not.  And one last thing.  Are you
			currently menstruating?

						HEAD LIBRARIAN
				(shocked)
			What&#39;s that got to do with it?

						VENKMAN
				(snaps)
			Back off, man!  I&#39;m a scientist!

THE DOOR

Spengler sticks his head in.

						SPENGLER
				(excited)
			It&#39;s moving!

Stantz and Venkman rush out.

INT. DEEP IN THE STACKS -- DAY

They come slowly down the dark aisle with Spengler leading, taking
constant readings.  Their faces are lit mainly by the light of their own
monitoring and recording equipment.

HIGH POV

Looking down on them from the spectral point of view.

A SPIRAL STAIRCASE

One by one, Venkman, Stantz and Spengler come down the tightly winding,
old iron staircase.  They are scared.  Books are strewn all over the
floor.

A BOOKSHELF

The books start to slide forward then the whole shelving unit topples over
and almost crushes the team under a ton of books.  They jump to safety.

						VENKMAN
			Nice.
				(out loud)
			Hello...

Spengler looks at his meters and silently points at a dark aisle
intersecting the one they&#39;re in.  The team inches toward it.

						SPENGLER
			It&#39;s here.

They stop at the corner.

INT. THE DARK AISLE -- DAY

The team peeks around the corner and looks toward camera.

THEIR POV -- DAY

An ethereal presence is hovering between the stacks about four feet off
the ground.  It seems to waver on the edge of being and non-being, then a
large legless, headless torso begins to emerge.

VENKMAN, STANTZ AND SPENGLER

They stand there amazed.

						STANTZ
				(whispers)
			What is it?

						VENKMAN
			It looks like a big pair of breasts and a
			pot belly.

THE TORSO -- DAY

A head and arms begin to form.  The apparition is now unmistakably a
full-bodied, somewhat elderly lady.

						SPENGLER
			It&#39;s a woman.

He edges closer to take valence readings.  Stantz starts snapping
infra-red photos of it.

						STANTZ
				(excited)
			I told you it&#39;s real.

						VENKMAN
				(whispers)
			What do we do now?

						STANTZ
				(whispers back)
			I don&#39;t know.  Talk to it.

						VENKMAN
				(nods in agreement then
				hesitates)
			What do I say?

						STANTZ
			Anything!  Just make contact.

						VENKMAN
				(takes a deep breath, then
				addresses the specter)
			Hey, Lady?
				(the apparition turns and
				seems to look right past
				them)
			Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?
				(no answer)
				(to Stantz)
			This is not working.  Think of something else.

						STANTZ
				(sotto voce)
			Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do.
			Stay close.  I have a plan.

He starts moving closer to the apparition.  Venkman and Spengler edge
closer, fighting their fear.  They stop just a few feet from the vision.

						STANTZ (CONT&#39;D)
				(whispers)
			Okay, now do exactly as I say. Everybody
			ready?

						VENKMAN &amp; SPENGLER
			Ready.

						STANTZ
			Okay...
				(shouts)
			GET HER!!!

He leaps at the apparition.  Venkman and Spengler jump reflexively at
almost the same moment but they all end up on the floor grabbing at thin
air.

THE GHOST -- DAY

She drops back a few feet, looms up into a raging demonlike specter and
blasts them with a rush of hot breath as she mouths a single word.

						THE GHOST
				(roars)
			QUIET!

VENKMAN, STANTZ AND SPENGLER

They scream and fall backwards.

EXT. LIBRARY -- MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY

They burst through the doors and onto the broad steps, both terrified and
exhilarated by their first real contact with the supernatural.  The Head
Librarian rushes out the door after them and chases them down the steps.

						HEAD LIBRARIAN
				(very agitated)
			Did you see it?  What was it?

						VENKMAN
			We&#39;ll get back to you.

EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY -- DAY.

Venkman, Stantz and Spengler head for their lab in Weaver Hall.  Spengler
makes rapid calculations as Venkman and Stantz argue.

						VENKMAN
				(steamed)
			&quot;Get her?&quot;  That was your whole plan?  You
			call that science?

						STANTZ
				(exultant)
			I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn&#39;t
			it incredible!  I&#39;m telling you, this is a
			first.  You know what this could mean to the
			University?

						VENKMAN
				(sarcastic)
			Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the
			microchip.  They&#39;ll probably throw out the
			entire engineering department and turn their
			building over to us.  We&#39;re probably the
			first serious scientists to ever molest a
			dead old lady.

						SPENGLER
				(consulting his
				mini-computer)
			I wouldn&#39;t say the experience was completely
			wasted.  Based on these new readings, I
			think we have an excellent chance of
			actually catching a ghost and holding it
			indefinitely.

Venkman stops dead in his tracks, stunned by the news.  Stantz and
Spengler continue walking.

						STANTZ
				(to Spengler; excited)
			Then we were right!  This is great.  And if
			the ionization rate is constant for all
			ectoplasmic entities, I think we could
			really kick ass -- in the spiritual sense.

Venkman catches up with them again.

						VENKMAN
			Spengler, are you serious about actually
			catching a ghost?

						SPENGLER
			I&#39;m always serious.

						VENKMAN
				(his mind reeling at the
				possibilities)
			Wow!

EXT. WEAVER HALL -- A LITTLE LATER

They approach the entrance to the psychology department talking excitedly.
Venkman stops at the door and turns to Spengler.

						VENKMAN
			Egon, I take back everything I ever said
			about you.  Take this.
				(he hands him a candy bar)
			You earned it.

They enter the building with Spengler greedily devouring the candy bar.

INT. WEAVER HALL -- DAY

They walk through the hall, then down the stairs to the basement.

						VENKMAN
				(his mind racing)
			If you guys are right, if we can actually
			trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I
			could win the Nobel Prize.

						STANTZ
				(protests)
			If anyone deserves it, it&#39;s Spengler and me.
			We&#39;re doing all the hard research and
			designing the equipment.

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, but I introduced you guys.  You never
			would&#39;ve met if not for me.  That&#39;s got to
			be worth something.

INT. THE BASEMENT -- DAY

A Workman in painter pants is at the door as Venkman, Stantz and Spengler
approach and enter the lab.  As soon as the door closes behind them, the
Workman starts scraping their names off the door with a razor blade.

INT. THE LAB -- DAY

As they enter, janitorial and maintenance personnel are busy dismantling
their apparatus and equipment.  DEAN YAEGER is supervising.  Venkman
confronts him.

						VENKMAN
				(shocked)
			I trust you&#39;re moving us to a better space
			somewhere on campus.

						DEAN YAEGER
			No, we&#39;re moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board
			of Regents has decided to terminate your
			grant.  You are to vacate these premises
			immediately.

						VENKMAN
			This is preposterous!  I demand an
			explanation.

						DEAN YAEGER
			Fine.  This University will no longer
			continue any funding of any kind for your
			group&#39;s activities.

						VENKMAN
			But why?  The students love us!

						DEAN YAEGER
			Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of
			science is to serve mankind.  You, however,
			seem to regard science as some kind of
			&quot;dodge&quot; or &quot;hustle.&quot;  Your theories are the
			worst kind of popular tripe, your methods
			are sloppy and your conclusions are highly
			questionable.  You&#39;re a poor scientist, Dr.
			Venkman, and you have no place in this
			department or in this University.

						VENKMAN
			I see.

						STANTZ
				(to Venkman)
			You said you floored &#39;em at the Regents&#39;
			meeting.

						VENKMAN
				(righteous)
			Ray, I apologize.
				(looking at Dean Yaeger)
			I guess my confidence in the Regents was
			misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.

						DEAN YAEGER
			It could be worse, Dr. Venkman.  They took
			the astronomer Phileas and staked his head
			to the town gate.

EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY -- DAY --  A LITTLE LATER

Stantz and Venkman are sitting on a bench both looking desolate.

						STANTZ
				(shaking his head)
			This is like a major disgrace.  Forget
			M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn&#39;t
			touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.

						VENKMAN
			You&#39;re always so worried about your
			reputation.  We don&#39;t need the University.
			Einstein did his best stuff while he was
			working as a patent clerk.&#39;They can&#39;t stop
			progress.

						STANTZ
				(not cheered)
			Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I
			liked the University.  They gave us money,
			they gave us the facilities and we didn&#39;t
			have to produce anything!  I&#39;ve worked in
			the private sector.  They expect results.
			You&#39;ve never been out of college.  You don&#39;t
			know what it&#39;s like out there.

						VENKMAN
				(with visionary zeal)
			Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life
			happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call
			it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were
			destined to get kicked out of there.

						STANTZ
			For what purpose?

						VENKMAN
				(with real conviction)
			To go into business for ourselves.

Stantz is immediately intrigued by the idea but voices his reservations.

						STANTZ
			I don&#39;t know.  That costs money.  And the
			ecto-containment system we have in mind will
			require a load of bread to capitalize.
			Where would we get the money?

EXT. WIDE ANGLE VIEW OF MANHATTAN -- DAY

EXT. AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS -- DAY

Venkman, Stantz and Spengler emerge from the Irving Trust headquarters,
all neatly dressed in suits.

						VENKMAN
			You&#39;ll never regret this, Ray.

						STANTZ
				(perturbed)
			My parents left me that house, I was born
			there.

						VENKMAN
			You&#39;re not going to lose the house.
			Everybody has three mortgages these days.

						STANTZ
			But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn&#39;t
			even bargain with the guy.

						SPENGLER
			(calculating)
			Just for your information, Ray, the interest
			payments alone for the first five years come
			to over $75,000.

						VENKMAN
			Will you guys relax?  We are on the
			threshold of establishing the indispensable
			defense science of the next decade -
			Professional Paranormal Investigations and
			Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone
			will make us wealthy beyond your wildest
			dreams.

						STANTZ
			But most people are afraid to even report
			these things.

						VENKMAN
			Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.

Stantz and Spengler exchange doubtful looks.

EXT. FIREHALL -- DAY

An abandoned brick, four-story fire station built by the city around the
turn of the century.  It bears a coat of faded red paint and legend above
the garage door in chipped gilt letters:  Engine Company #93.  The garage
doors open revealing Venkman standing in the white-tiled garage bay with a
middle aged REAL ESTATE WOMAN wearing a blazer.

INT. GARAGE BAY -- DAY

Venkman is looking around.

						R/E WOMAN
			Besides this, you&#39;ve got another substantial
			work area on the ground floor, office space,
			sleeping quarters and showers on the next
			floor, and you have your full kitchen on the
			top level.  It&#39;s 10,000 square feet total.

SPENGLER

He comes out of the office area with a pocket calculator.

						SPENGLER
			It&#39;s 9,642.55 square feet.

The Realtor frowns at Spengler.

						R/E WOMAN
			What is he -- your accountant?

STANTZ

He is looking at the shiny brass fire pole.

						STANTZ
				(shouts, loving it)
			Wow!  Does this pole still work?

						VENKMAN
				(considering but not
				wanting to appear too
				eager)
			This might do ... I don&#39;t know ... it just
			seems kind of &quot;pricey&quot; for a fixer-upper,
			don&#39;t you think?  We&#39;re trying to keep our
			costs down.  You know how it is when you&#39;re
			starting a new company.

						R/E WOMAN
			Yes, I know.  What are you calling your
			business?

						STANTZ
			Ghostbusters.

						R/E WOMAN
			Oh, well, this place is perfect for it.

EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE -- DAY

A high panoramic view of the city shows heavy traffic moving up and down
Central Park West on a beautiful sunny day.

EXT. 78th AND CENTRAL PARK WEST -- DAY

An unusual pre-war Gothic high-rise towers over the neighborhood
buildings.  The top of the building includes an elaborate decorative
temple, complete with altar, stairs and Babylonian columns.  The late
afternoon sun gives the structure an oddly menacing quality.  The camera
PANS slowly down to the street as DANA BARRETT, an attractive woman in her
late twenties, comes walking up to the building carrying a cello case and
a shopping bag full of groceries.  Guys on the street check her out as she
enters, but she coolly ignores them.

INT. HIGH-RISE APARTMENT BUILDING -- LOBBY -- DAY

Dana crosses the lobby and gets into the elevator.

INT. THIRTY FIFTH FLOOR -- DAY

Dana gets off the elevator and goes to the door of her apartment.  As she
unlocks it, the door to the next apartment opens and Dana&#39;s neighbor,
LOUIS TULLY, peeks his head out the door. Louis is a shy nerd, hopelessly
in love with Dana.

						LOUIS
			Oh, Dana, it&#39;s you ...

						DANA
				(she&#39;s seen this before)
			Hi, Louis.

						LOUIS
			... I thought it was the drug store.

						DANA
			Are you sick, Louis?

Louis has broken the ice. He confidently exits his apartment and
approaches Dana.  His door slams behind him as he leaves.

						LOUIS
			Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some
			more vitamins.  I see you were exercising.
			So was I.  I taped &quot;20 Minute Workout&quot; and
			played it back at high speed so it only took
			ten minutes and I got a really good workout.
			You wanna have a mineral water with me?

						DANA
			No thanks, Louis.  I&#39;m really tired.  I&#39;ve
			been rehearsing all morning.

						LOUIS
			Okay.  I&#39;ll take a raincheck.  I always have
			plenty of mineral water and other nutritious
			health foods, but you know that.  Listen,
			that reminds me, I&#39;m having a party for all
			my clients.  It&#39;s gonna be my fourth
			anniversary as an accountant.  I know you
			fill out your own tax return, but I&#39;d like
			you to come being that you&#39;re my next door
			neighbor and all ...

						DANA
			Oh, that&#39;s nice, Louis.  I&#39;ll stop by if
			I&#39;m around.

						LOUIS
			You know you shouldn&#39;t leave your TV on so
			loud when you go out.  That creep down the
			hall phoned the manager.

						DANA
			I thought I turned it off.
				(she listens and hears
				loud sound coming from
				inside)
			I guess I forgot.

Dana begins unlocking her door.

						LOUIS
			I climbed on the window ledge to see if I
			could disconnect the cable but I couldn&#39;t
			reach so I turned up the sound on my TV real
			loud so they&#39;d think there was something
			wrong with everybody&#39;s TV.  You know, you
			and I should really have keys to each
			other&#39;s apartment ...

Her door closes leaving Louis stranded.  He walks back to his apartment
muttering to himself.

						LOUIS (CONT&#39;D)
			... in case of emergencies ...
				(he discovers he has
				locked himself out of his
				apartment)
			... like this one.

DANA&#39; S APARTMENT -- DAY

A roomy, two-bedroom flat with a great view of the park.

She leaves the cello in the entrance hall, grabs the bag of groceries and
goes through the living room toward the kitchen.

Remembering Louis, she stops at the TV set to turn it off, but a strange
image on the screen catches her attention.

TV SCREEN
INT. CHILDREN&#39;S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Two children, a BOY and a GIRL, are asleep in bed when suddenly they are
awakened by supernatural moaning and groaning.

THE CHILDREN

They scream and jump out of bed.

THE DOOR

Their MOTHER and FATHER, rush in to find the children cowering against the
wall.

						FATHER
			What is it?  What&#39;s wrong?

						THE KIDS
			Look!

They point at the closet.

						MOTHER
				(to Father)
			Oh, dear.  It&#39;s that darn ghost again.
			Can&#39;t you do something about it.

						FATHER
				(helpless)
			I&#39;ve tried everything, honey!  I guess we&#39;ll
			just have to move.

The mother and the kids look at him with disappointment.

						MOTHER
			Gee, there must be a better way.

Stantz steps into the foreground.

						STANTZ
			Are you troubled by strange noises in the
			night?  Do you experience feelings of dread
			in your basement or attic?  Have you or your
			family actually seen a spook, specter or
			ghost?  If the answer is yes, then don&#39;t
			wait another minute.  Just pick up the phone
			and call the professionals -- Ghostbusters.

EXT. FIREHALL

Venkman, Stantz and Spengler are standing in front of the Ghostbusters&#39;
sign.  Spengler steps forward.

						SPENGLER
				(to camera)
			Our courteous and efficient staff is on call
			24 hours a day to serve all your supernatural
			elimination needs.

INT. RECEPTION AREA

Janine is seen answering the telephone with a big fake smile on her face.

						JANINE
				(cheery)
			Ghostbusters.  We&#39;ll be right there.

INT. CHILDREN&#39;S BEDROOM

Spengler is taking PKE readings along the baseboards.  Stantz pops up from
under the bed.

						STANTZ
				(smiling proudly)
			Got him!  I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll have any more
			trouble with that ghost.

FATHER, MOTHER AND VENKMAN

They all look as pleased as punch as Venkman hands the Father a bill.

						FATHER
				(looks at the total)
			And it&#39;s economical, too!

						MOTHER
			How can we ever thank you?

						VENKMAN
				(big, cheesy smile)
			All in a day&#39;s work, ma&#39;am. After all ...
				(to camera)
			... We&#39;re Ghostbusters.
				(he winks)

EXT. FRONT DOOR

Mother, Father and Kids wave goodbye to the Ghostbusters.

						THE FAMILY
				(sings)
			If you have a ghost,
			But you don&#39;t want to play host,
			You can&#39;t sleep at all,
			So who do you call ...
			Ghostbusters - Ghostbusters.

VENKMAN, STANTZ AND SPENGLER

They smile at the camera as a phone number is supered on the screen.

						GHOSTBUSTERS
				(in unison)
			We&#39;re ready to believe you,

Dana turns off the TV set and goes into the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN

Dana switches on the radio and starts unpacking groceries.  She sets a
loaf of bread and a carton of eggs on the counter and begins putting other
items away in the pantry.

THE EGGS

The top of the carton pops open.  Then, one by one, the eggs erupt and
spill over onto the counter.  As the liquid contents hit the countertop
they sizzle.  The eggs begin to fry on the formica surface.

DANA

She hears the sizzle, turns and sees the eggs frying.  She gasps, then
recovers and inspects the mess.  She touches the counter gingerly, but
it&#39;s not at all hot. Deeply perplexed, she stands there trying to think of
an explanation.  Then a strange new sound attracts her attention and she
turns around to see where it&#39;s coming from.

Dana hears the sound of muffled chanting coming from the fridge.  She
pulls the door open and gets the shock of her life.  The inside of the
fridge has been transformed into the Gateway to another Realm -- a fiery
path leading to a temple door.  On each side of the door is a strange,
snarling creature that could best be described as a TERROR DOG.  Their
front claws are raised toward each other in a symbolic pose.  The
incredible vision is accompanied by the unearthly chanting.

DANA

She stands there transfixed by horror, the flames reflecting in her eyes.

THE FRIDGE

The chanting gets more frenetic and ominous as the temple doors slowly
begin to open.

DANA

She is paralyzed.

THE TEMPLE DOORS

They continue to open.  We feel a terrible presence within.

						THE PRESENCE
				(whispers loudly and
				hoarsely)
			ZUUL!!!

DANA

She screams and slams the refrigerator door.  Instantly, everything is
normal again.  She looks around the room.

THE EGGS

They are back in the carton, unbroken.

DANA

Fighting her fear, she turns back to the fridge and very slowly reaches
for the handle.  Then summoning all her courage, she yanks open the door.
Ketchup, mustard, bottles of vitamins and other food items fall out of the
rack on the inside of the refrigerator door.  Dana sighs with relief as
she sees nothing but the cool white porcelain interior of the fridge.  She
closes the door and stands there for a moment still shaken by the vision.
Then she shakes her head and leaves the kitchen.

EXT. FIREHALL -- DAY

The garage bay door is open.  Two painters on scaffolding are completing a
paint job on the front of the structure in flat black paint.  A carpenter
finishes hanging a sign over the door.  It reads:  GHOSTBUSTERS.

Then Stantz comes driving up in a very long, gold 1959 Cadillac ambulance
and turns into the garage bay of the firehall. The car has a battered look
to it and rumbles noisily due to a broken muffler.

INT. GARAGE BAY -- DAY

Stantz hits the siren and flashes the emergency lights as he drives in.
Venkman crosses to the car as Stantz jumps out enthusiastically.

						STANTZ
			Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How
			do you like it?

						VENKMAN
				(not terribly pleased)
			Do you think it&#39;s wide enough?  How much?

						STANTZ
			Fourteen hundred.

Venkman steps on the front bumper and rocks it.  It wallows badly.

						STANTZ
			Just needs a little suspension work ... And
			a muffler ... And maybe brakes.

RECEPTION AREA -- DAY

A bored-looking red-headed young woman, JANINE MELNITZ, sits in a swivel
chair behind the reception desk, putting another coat of red polish on her
heavily lacquered nails.  Spengler is on his hands and knees wiring up the
telephone system.

						JANINE
				(with a definitive Queens
				accent)
			You&#39;re very handy, I can tell.  I bet you
			like to read a lot, too.

						SPENGLER
				(looks up)
			Print is dead.

						JANINE
			That&#39;s very fascinating to me.  I read a
			lot myself.  Some people think I&#39;m too
			intellectual.  But I think reading is a
			fabulous way to spend your spare time.
				(he doesn&#39;t answer)
			I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?

						SPENGLER
			Is that a game?

						JANINE
			It&#39;s a great game!  You should play
			sometime.  I bet you&#39;d be good.  You seem
			very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?

						SPENGLER
			I collect spores, molds and fungus.

						JANINE
			Oh, that&#39;s very - unusual.

						SPENGLER
			I think it&#39;s the food of the future.

						JANINE
			Remind me not to go to lunch with you.

THE DOOR

Dana Barrett enters ance looks around hesitantly,

VENKMAN

He springs into action.

						VENKMAN
				(all charm)
			Hello.  I&#39;m Peter Venkman.  May I help you?

						DANA
			Yes ... well ... I&#39;m not sure.  What I have
			to say may sound a little ... unusual.

						VENKMAN
			We&#39;re all professionals here, Miss ...

						DANA
			Barrett.  Dana Barrett.

They walk toward the inner office.

						VENKMAN
			Why don&#39;t you step into the office and we&#39;ll
			talk about it.
				(to Janine)
			Hold all my calls, Janine.

						JANINE
			What calls?

Venkman frowns and exits with Dana.

INSERT -- TV MONITOR -- LATER

Dana is seen in close-up on a TV screen as she finishes telling about her
experience.

						DANA
			... and then I opened the door again but it
			was gone.  There was nothing there.

						VENKMAN
				(off-camera)
			So what do you think it was?

INT. OFFICE -- SAME TIME

Dana is hooked up to a lie detector.  Spengler is monitoring the readout
and videotaping the interview.  Venkman and Stantz are listening intently,
waiting for Dana&#39;s assessment of her experience.

						DANA
				(after a long pause)
			I think something in my refrigerator is
			trying to get me.

Venkman stares at her, trying to make sense of her last statement.

						VENKMAN
			Generally, you don&#39;t see that kind of
			behavior in a major appliance.  What do you
			think, Egon?

						SPENGLER
				(checking the polygraph)
			She&#39;s telling the truth -- or at least she
			thinks she is.

						DANA
				(defensive)
			Why would anyone make up a thing like that?

						VENKMAN
			Some people like the attention.  Some people
			are just crazy.

						STANTZ
				(muses)
			You know, Peter, this could be a past life
			experience intruding on the present.

						SPENGLER
			Or even a race memory, stored in the
			collective unconscious.  And I wouldn&#39;t rule
			out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.

Dana starts laughing.  They all regard her curiously.

						DANA
				(trying to be serious)
			I&#39;m sorry.  It&#39;s just that I don&#39;t believe
			in any of these things.  I don&#39;t even know
			my sign.

						SPENGLER
				(checks his notes)
			You&#39;re a Scorpio with your moon in Leo and
			Aquarius rising.

						DANA
			Is that good?

						VENKMAN
			It means you&#39;re bright, ambitious, outgoing
			and very, very sexy,

Dana looks at Venkman, flattered by the remark but more than a little
suspicious of his motives.

						DANA
			Is that your professional opinion?

						VENKMAN
			It&#39;s in the stars.

						STANTZ
			Why don&#39;t I check out the building?  It may
			have a history of psychic turbulence.

						VENKMAN
			Good idea.
				(to Dana)
			Were any other words spoken that you
			remember?

						DANA
			No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have
			no idea what it means.

						VENKMAN
			Spengler,  see if you can find the word
			&quot;Zuul&quot; in any of the literature.  I&#39;ll take
			Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.

INT. DANA&#39;S APARTMENT -- LATER THAT AFTERNOON

The door opens and Dana enters the darkened flat with Venkman. She
switches on the light and leads him to the living room.

						VENKMAN
			Have you ever thought of moving out -- at
			least until this disturbance blows over?

						DANA
			No.  If I moved out now I&#39;d be acknowledging
			that what happened was real.  I&#39;m not ready
			to do that.

Venkman sees the cello leaning up against the wall.

						VENKMAN
			You play the cello!  It&#39;s my favorite
			instrument.

						DANA
			Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?

						VENKMAN
				(thinks)
			I&#39;d have to say Prokofiev&#39;s third concerto.

						DANA
			That&#39;s a violin concerto.

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, but it&#39;s got a great cello break.

He grabs the cello and starts playing it like a stand-up base.  Dana takes
the instrument out of his hands and gently puts it back in the case.

						DANA
			You really don&#39;t act like a scientist.

						VENKMAN
			No?  What do I act like?

						DANA
			Like a used car salesman.

						VENKMAN
			Thanks.
				(he gets down to business
				and starts looking around
				the apartment)
			What&#39;s in there?

He points to a door.

						DANA
			That&#39;s the bedroom, but nothing ever
			happened in there.

She takes off her jacket.

						VENKMAN
				(noticing her body)
			That&#39;s too bad.

						DANA
			What?

						VENKMAN
			Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?

He points to another door.

						DANA
				(nods)
			Uh-huh.

						VENKMAN
			Well, let&#39;s check it out.

						DANA
			I&#39;ll wait here if you don&#39;t mind.

He enters the kitchen.

INT. THE KITCHEN -- DAY

The room is a real mess.  Utensils are lying all over the floor.  The
cabinets and walls are splattered with food.

						VENKMAN
				(calls out)
			You&#39;re quite a housekeeper.

						DANA
				(off-camera)
			I told you, I ...

						VENKMAN
			I know.  It happened by itself.

He scans the room with his monitoring device.

						VENKMAN (CONT&#39;D)
			Nothing.

He looks in a couple of cabinets, then confronts the refrigerator.  With
mild trepidation he grasps the door handle, then suddenly jerks it open.
The handle comes off in his hand.

						VENKMAN (CONT&#39;D)
			Damn!

						DANA
				(off-camera)
			Are you all right?

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, yeah.

He grips the side of the fridge door and pulls it open.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Dana stands there nervously watching the kitchen door.  Finally, it opens
and Venkman comes out munching an apple.

						VENKMAN
			There&#39;s nothing there now and I don&#39;t get
			any significant readings.

						DANA
			This is terrible.  Either there&#39;s a monster
			in my kitchen or I&#39;m completely crazy.

						VENKMAN
			If it&#39;s any comfort to you, I don&#39;t think
			you&#39;re crazy.

						DANA
				(laughs ironically)
			Thanks.  Coming from you that really means
			a lot to me.

						VENKMAN
			I&#39;m a qualified psychologist.  I&#39;ve got a
			degree and everything.  I believe that
			something happened here and I want to do
			something about it.

						DANA
			All right.  What do you want to do?

						VENKMAN
			I think I should spend the night here.

						DANA
				(she&#39;s had enough)
			That&#39;s it.  Get out.

						VENKMAN
			On a purely scientific basis.

						DANA
			Out!

						VENKMAN
			I want to help you.

						DANA
			I&#39;ll scream.

						VENKMAN
			Don&#39;t scream.

						DANA
				(urging him to the door)
			Then leave.

						VENKMAN
			Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens,
			you have to promise you&#39;ll call me.

						DANA
				(opening the door)
			All right.

						VENKMAN
			Okay.  Then I&#39;ll go.

						DANA
			Goodbye.

						VENKMAN
				(in the hall)
			No kiss?

She closes the door in his face and triple locks it.

EXT. HALLWAY -- DAY

Venkman stands there with his nose flattened against Dana&#39;s door.  He
starts to leave just as Louis Tully pokes his head out the door hoping to
see Dana.  He jealously eyes Venkman.  Venkman ignores Louis and gets on
the elevator.

Louis spots his newspaper lying on the floor across the hall.  Holding the
door open with one foot, he reaches for the paper but can&#39;t quite stretch
far enough.  Trying another approach, he swings the door open, leaps for
the paper and darts back to the door just as it slams shut in his face,
locking him out again.

INT. FIREHALL KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Stantz and Spengler are eating Chinese food from several take-out
containers.  Venkman enters.

						STANTZ
			How was your date?

						VENKMAN
			It wasn&#39;t a date.  It was an investigation.

						SPENGLER
			Did you see anything?

						VENKMAN
			Didn&#39;t see anything,  Didn&#39;t get anything.
			Nice girl - no ghost.  I&#39;m starting to
			worry.  You said your graph was pointing to
			something big.  You told me things were
			going to start popping.

						STANTZ
			They will.

						VENKMAN
			Do you know when that might be?  We&#39;re on
			the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.

He plucks a garlic shrimp from one of the Chinese food cartons and walks
off disconsolately.

EXT. HOTEL SEDGEWICK -- NIGHT

Two uniformed DOORMEN help people in and out of taxis and limos under the
hotel&#39;s elegant awning.

INT. HOTEL -- NIGHT

A &quot;DO NOT DISTURB&quot;  sign hangs on the doorknob of Room 1210.  Soft music
is heard coming from the room.

INT. ROOM 1210 -- NIGHT

The room is dark but we can hear the sighs and heavy breathing of a man
and woman making love on the bed.  The camera PANS across the floor
following a trail of dropped clothing -- a  tuxedo jacket and cummerbund,
white satin high heels, a lacy wedding gown, striped tuxedo trousers,
satin ladies underpants, stockings and garters.

						BRIDE (V.O.)
			Aren&#39;t you glad we waited?

						GROOM (V.O.)
			I don&#39;t know.  It probably would&#39;ve been the
			same.

						BRIDE (V.O.)
				(indignant)
			Well, thanks a lot.

THE BED

The Groom turns his back to the Bride and pulls the sheet up to his neck.

						BRIDE
			What are you doing?  Are you just going to
			roll over and go to sleep?
				(he doesn&#39;t respond)
			I don&#39;t believe this.

She switches on the lamp on the nightstand and picks up a magazine.

THE AIR VENT

There is a throbbing shudder as if something powerful was rushing through
the air duct.  A hint of yellowy vapor wafts through the grating and into
the room.

THE NIGHTSTAND

The travel clock reads 9:45 P.M.  Suddenly there is an audible hiss, then
the glass clockface cracks down the middle with a snap.

THE BRIDE

Startled, she looks at the clock and picks it up to examine it.

						BRIDE
			Roy?  Your clock broke.

						GROOM
			Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.

						BRIDE
			I didn&#39;t break your precious clock, Roy!

He gets up and heads for the bathroom.

						BRIDE (CONT&#39;D)
			Now where are you going?

						GROOM
			To the bathroom, where do you think?

						BRIDE
				(to herself)
			Have I done the right thing?

The Groom enters the bathroom and closes the door behind him.  The sound
of water running in the sink is heard.  Then the Bride hears a sound like
the noise a cat makes when trying to dislodge a hairball from its throat.

						BRIDE
				(calls out)
			Roy?  Are you all right?

The noise increases to the level of ten cats with hairballs.

						BRIDE
				(disgusted)
			Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!

						GROOM (O.S.)
			Uuuuuuugh!!

						BRIDE
				(getting quite nervous)
			What&#39;s the matter, dear?

She gets out of bed just as he comes charging out, stuttering in stunned
horror.  She goes into the bathroom.

						BRIDE (V.O.)
			What did you do in here?  It smells awful!!
			OH ... Oh, no ... Oh, my God.

The Bride runs out of the bathroom into the arms of her husband who is on
the telephone.

						GROOM
			... right ... It&#39;s smelling up the whole
			suite ... I don&#39;t know ... It&#39;s just hanging
			off the ceiling ... I&#39;ve never seen anything
			like this ... 1210 ... Quick ...

INT. FIREHALL OFFICE -- NIGHT

Janine turns off the light at her desk.  She packs up her purse and puts
on her coat.  The phone rings.  Janine answers it unenthusiastically.

						JANINE
			Ghostbusters ... Yes, it is ... Yes, of
			course they&#39;re serious.  You do!  You have!
			Yes, sir.  Well, they&#39;re out on another case
			now, but if you&#39;ll give me the address ...
			Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;ll be totally discreet.

She hits an alarm button and a loud bell starts ringing frantically.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

The alarm sounds and everyone jumps up, scattering takeout cartons.

INT. DORM -- NIGHT

The alarm continues.  Everyone enters in haste and scrambles into
jumpsuits.  There is much hopping on one leg and bumping into one another.

BRASS POLE

Fully suited, Venkman jumps on and slides down followed quickly by
Spengler.  Then Stantz jumps at it but hits it at the wrong angle.  He
slowly slides down out of sight with a stunned look on his face.

INT. GARAGE BAY -- EQUIPMENT RACKS -- NIGHT

Everyone pulls throwers, traps, packs and harnesses off the wall.

EXT. FIREHALL -- NIGHT

The garage door slides up and in a blaze of light and screeching tires,
the ambulance squeals out and makes a right turn. The vehicle  has been
painted flat black and has been fitted with communication wafers and
antennae.  All the original lights have been replaced with purple and
white strobes and the siren has been altered to emit a low, unearthly
moaning  The purple and white strobe bars give the car a strange
ultraviolet aura.  It rounds the corner and heads up the West Side
Highway.

EXT. HOTEL -- FRONT DOOR -- NIGHT

The black ambulance screeches up to the main entrance, siren blaring.
Emblazoned on the door is the Ghostbusters&#39; new logo.  It&#39;s the
international symbol of prohibition, a red circle with a diagonal red
stroke across a ghost.  The DOORMAN steps forward as Venkman, Stantz and
Spengler leap out of the car.  They open up the rear door and remove their
equipment.  People on the street stop and gawk.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

As the Ghostbusters enter, people turn and stare at their strange
appearance.  They all wear matching blue futuristic jumpsuits with proton
packs strapped to their backs.  They also wear brushed-metal, flip-down
ecto-visors worn on the head like a welder&#39;s mask.  Knee and elbow pads
complete their strange outfits.

VENKMAN

He looks ill-at-ease and embarrassed by their outlandish getups as the
HOTEL MANAGER descends on them accompanied by a Slavic MAINTENANCE MAN and
a worried BELL CAPTAIN.

						MANAGER
				(agitated)
			Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests
			are starting to ask questions and I&#39;m running
			out of excuses.

						STANTZ
			Has this ever happened before?

						MANAGER
			Well, most of the original staff knows about
			the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I
			mean ... But it&#39;s been quiet for years ...
			Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever
			this bad, though.

						STANTZ
			Did you ever report it to anyone?

						MANAGER
			Heavens, no!  The owners don&#39;t like us to
			even talk about it.  I hoped we could take
			care of this quietly tonight.

						STANTZ
			Yes, sir.  Don&#39;t worry.  We handle this kind
			of thing all the time.

They cross the lobby to the elevators, attracting lots of curious interest
from the hotel guests.

VENKMAN

A GUEST accosts him while they wait for an elevator.

						GUEST
			What are you supposed to be?

						VENKMAN
			Me?  We&#39;re ... uh ... the exterminators.
			Somebody saw a cockroach on the twelfth floor.

The Guest looks at Venkman, noting the heavy proton pack on his back, the
odd-looking particle thrower and flipdown ecto-visor.

						GUEST
			That&#39;s gotta be some cockroach,

						VENKMAN
			Well, you can&#39;t be too careful with those
			babies.

The elevator arrives and he gets on with the others.

INT. THE ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

The Ghostbusters look nervous as they ride up the elevator.

						STANTZ
			I just realized something.  We&#39;ve never had
			a completely successful test with any of the
			equipment.

						SPENGLER
			I blame myself.

						VENKMAN
			So do I.

						STANTZ
			No sense worrying about it now.

						VENKMAN
				(doubtful)
			Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed
			nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem.

The elevator stops at the Twelfth Floor.

INT. TWELFTH FLOOR CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

The elevator doors open and Venkman peeks out into the hall.  He steps out
cautiously, followed by the others.

THE END OF THE HALL

A BELLBOY comes around the corner behind them, pushing a room service cart
loaded with dirty dishes.

STANTZ

He hears the rattle of the dishes behind him, whirls and fires a stream of
protons from his wand.  Spengler is so keyed up, he too spins and fires
wildly.

THE BELLBOY

He ducks as the particle streams blow the dishes off the cart and scorch
holes in the wall behind him.

						VENKMAN
				(shouts)
			Cease fire!

The Bellboy peeks out from behind the cart.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They breathe a sigh of relief.

						STANTZ
				(to the Bellboy)
			Sorry, Buddy!

						SPENGLER
			We&#39;d better adjust our streams.

He leads them down the hall to Room 1210.

INT. ROOM 1210 -- NIGHT

The Ghostbusters enter trepidatiously and start taking readings.

						SPENGLER
				(looking at his meters)
			Something was definitely here.

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, I can smell it.

						STANTZ
			I&#39;m getting high readings near the air
			vents.  It must be using the duct system to
			get around.  See, I told you we&#39;d get
			something.

						VENKMAN
			So far all we got is a shit smell on the
			twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto
			Rican bellboy.

						STANTZ
			All right.  Let&#39;s cool the negative vibes.
			These things can sense them.

They exit the room.

INT. A CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

Spengler makes his way down the hall reading valences at the door to each
room.  He knocks on one of the doors, then passes his sensor over the top
of the door and down the jambs.  Then he gets on his knees to read the
crack at the bottom of the door.  Suddenly the door opens and he looks up
to see a really stunning woman wrapped in a bath towel with another towel
twisted turban-style around her wet hair.

						WOMAN
				(noting his unusual attire)
			Yes?

						SPENGLER
				(stands up)
			Were you recently in the bathroom?

						WOMAN
				(sarcastic)
			What on earth gave you that idea?

						SPENGLER
				(seriously)
			The wet towels, residual moisture on your
			lower limbs and hair, the redness in your
			cheeks indicating ...

						WOMAN
				(cutting him off)
			You&#39;re a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what
			do you want?

						SPENGLER
			When you were in the bathroom, did you
			notice anything that was yellow and
			unusually smelly?

She slams the door in his face.  Spengler shrugs and moves on.

INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR -- SAME TIME

Stantz moves down the hall checking PKE valences.

HIS PKE METER

The needle jumps into the red.

STANTZ

He alerts Spengler through the walkie-talkie headset he wears.

						STANTZ
				(hushed)
			Egon!  I got something.  I&#39;m moving in.

Slowly and cautiously, he turns the corner at the end of the hall.
Suddenly, he sees the object of their search and freezes.

						STANTZ
				(frightened)
			Yaaaaaaaaah!

STANTZ&#39; POV

The vapor is hunched over a room service cart loaded with dirty dishes.
It hangs there, translucent, foul, yellow, feeding off table scraps and
leftover beverages, knocking dishes off the cart and scattering refuse.
It looks like a misshapen potato with a pushed-in face and spindly arms.

						SPENGLER
				(over the walkie-talkie)
			Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?

						STANTZ
				(amazed)
			God, it&#39;s ugly!

THE VAPOR

It raises a half-empty bottle of wine to its gaping maw and chugs down the
liquid.  The wine is visible as it pours down his gullet and passes
through his system, finally spilling through his body onto the floor.

STANTZ

He edges closer.

						STANTZ
				(whispers into his head
				set)
			I&#39;m moving in.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s seen me
			yet.

THE VAPOR

It crams some leftovers into its mouth and belches loudly.

STANTZ

He is growing increasingly more disgusted as the initial fear leaves him.

						STANTZ
			Ugh!  What a slob!  I&#39;m going to take him.
				(shouts at the vapor)
			Freeze, Potato-Face!

He fires his particle thrower at the vapor.

THE VAPOR

It dodges Stantz&#39; first shot and the ion stream tears away fifty feet of
wallpaper in a searing ricochet.  Then the vapor flies off down the hall,
pulling the room service cart along in its wake.

STANTZ

He chases it down the hall, shouting into his headset.

						STANTZ
			He&#39;s getting away!

THE VAPOR

It reaches the end of the corridor but instead of turning, it passes right
through the solid wall.  The room service cart crashes into the wall,
smashing dishes and sending the debris flying.

INT. A HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

A MAN is just pulling the plastic bag off his recently dry-cleaned white
dinner jacket when the noxious vapor comes shooting through the wall.  It
blows right over him with a great rush of stinking wind and exits through
the air vent.

THE MAN

He looks at the air vent then back at his dinner jacket which has turned
several shades of sickly yellow and brown.

INT. A CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

Venkman is alone in a long hallway.  He leans against the wall, clearly
not taking any of this seriously.  He hauls on a cigarette and mutters to
himself.

						VENKMAN
			This bites it.  I actually work for a
			company called Ghostbusters.

Suddenly from the end of the hallway comes the sound of rattling dishes
and silverware, accompanied by footsteps.  Venkman&#39;s PKE meter beeps and a
red light winks on.

						VENKMAN (CONT&#39;D)
				(into the walkie-talkie)
			Ray -- Something&#39;s here.

						STANTZ (O.S.)
				(crackling over the
				communicator)
			Where are you, Pete?

						VENKMAN
				(backing away)
			Third floor.  Get down here,

						STANTZ
			Sit tight.  I&#39;m on my way.

						VENKMAN
			Well, hurry up.
				(checks his meter)
			The needle&#39;s going wild.

VENKMAN&#39;S POV

A room service cart sails past along a perpendicular hallway and rolls out
of sight.  Then immediately behind it comes a reeking yellow haze.  It is
the vapor.  It doesn&#39;t follow the cart but instead makes the turn at the
end of the hall and hovers there, apparently looking at Venkman.

VENKMAN

He&#39;s scared now.

						VENKMAN
				(into his head set)
			It&#39;s here, Ray.  It&#39;s looking at me.

						STANTZ
				(on the radio)
			Don&#39;t move.  It won&#39;t hurt you.

						VENKMAN
			How do you know?

						STANTZ
			I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m just guessing.

Venkman sees the vapor start down the hall toward him.

						VENKMAN
				(panicking)
			Well, I think you guessed wrong.  Here he
			comes!

THE VAPOR

It flies down the hall toward Venkman.

INT. STAIRWELL -- SAME TIME

Stantz runs downstairs taking them three at a time as Venkman is heard
screaming over the radio.

						VENKMAN
				(screaming)
			Veeaaaaaahh!

INT. THIRD FLOOR

Stantz comes running around the corner and sees Venkman flat on his back,
flailing his arms and legs frantically,  Sickening, yellow-green ectofluid
covers his head and chest.

						VENKMAN
			Aagghh -- aaaggghh -- uhh -- uhh -- It slimed
			me!  It slimed me!

Suddenly Spengler&#39;s voice crackles over the communicator.

						SPENGLER (V.O.)
			Ray!  It&#39;s here!  It just went into the
			Banquet Room on the third floor.

Stantz helps Venkman to his feet and they rush off.

INT. BANQUET ROOM -- NIGHT

The Ghostbusters enter a large dark room with a high, ornately-corniced
ceiling and a crystal chandelier hanging in the center.

						STANTZ
			Visors down.  Full stream.

They flip down their visors and scan the room.

STANTZ

He peruses the room but sees nothing.  He looks up and scans the ceiling.
A form flits behind a carved beam.

						STANTZ
			There!  On the ceiling!
				(the others look)
			Come on down here, you slug!

Stantz drops to one knee and fires at the vapor.

THE CEILING

The vapor dodges as the beam blasts a sizable chunk of plaster out of the
ceiling and destroys half the crystal chandelier.

VENKMAN

He fires at it, too, wasting the rest of the chandelier but the vapor
dodges away.  They are both ready to start blazing away again when
Spengler stops them.

						SPENGLER
				(urgently)
			Wait!  Wait!  There&#39;s something I forgot to
			tell you.

						VENKMAN
			What?

						SPENGLER
				(emphatic)
			Don&#39;t cross the beams.

						VENKMAN
			Why not?

						SPENGLER
			Trust me.  It will be bad.

						VENKMAN
			What do you mean &quot;bad?&quot;

						SPENGLER
			It&#39;s hard to explain, but try to imagine
			all life as you know it stopping
			instantaneously and finding yourself
			confined forever in another dimension.

Venkman considers his own safety and decides to take charge.

						VENKMAN
				(with military authority)
			That&#39;s it!  I&#39;m taking charge.  You guys
			are dangerous.

They yield command to him.

						VENKMAN (CONT&#39;D)
			Now nobody does anything unless I order you
			to, okay?

STANTZ AND SPENGLER

They nod obediently and glance nervously at the vapor, still hovering near
the ceiling.

						VENKMAN
			Let&#39;s do it.  This thing&#39;s not going to hang
			around all day waiting for us.  Ray, give me
			one stream wide right of it. I&#39;ll go wide
			left.  Now!

STANTZ AND VENKMAN

They trigger their throwers and two streams are emitted, shooting off to
either side of the entity.  The entity swirls but stays between the beams.

						VENKMAN
				(talking them through it)
			Good ... Good ... Nice and wide ... Move
			with him ... Easy.  Hold steady.

THE VAPOR

It bobs and weaves, trying to slip past the visible lines of light, but
Venkman and Stantz manage to keep it boxed in.

						VENKMAN
				(speaking clearly)
			Now, very slowly, Ray, let&#39;s tighten it up.
			You hold steady.  I&#39;m coming down.

They start closing the distance between their ion streams.

						SPENGLER
				(cautious)
			Don&#39;t cross them!  Watch it!

STANTZ

The vapor is trying to get around his streams, causing him to waver as
Venkman&#39;s stream gets closer and closer.

						VENKMAN
			Spengler! A little help!  Cut him off.

THE VAPOR

It slips past Stantz and races for the air vent.

SPENGLER

He fires with such poor marksmanship that he comes only centimeters from
crossing Venkman&#39;s stream. Venkman jerks away to avoid crossing Spengler&#39;s
erratic bursts and maneuvers.  Together they do extensive damage to the
walls.

INT. CORRIDOR -- SAME TIME

The Hotel Manager and the Maintenance Man look nervously at each other as
they hear the sound of heavy property damage coming from the banquet room.

INT. BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT

Stantz has the thing cornered to some extent.

						STANTZ
				(to Venkman)
			I&#39;ll nudge it out of the corner.  You cut
			off the left side.

Stantz moves closer to the wall and Venkman counters to trap the vapor
again.

						VENKMAN
				(encouragingly)
			You got it!  That&#39;s good.  Easy now.

They manage to guide the vapor out into the center of the room, all the
time closing the figurative box around it.

						STANTZ
			It&#39;s working!

						SPENGLER
			Easy ... Easy ... I&#39;m going to throw in my
			trap now.

Spengler jerks his leg up, triggering a release on his equipment belt.  A
cord and foot pedal fall to the floor.  At the end of the cord there is a
long, flat black metal box two feet long, four inches wide and two high.
He kicks the box under the apparition and toes the foot pedal into
position. The apparition blasts them with a flatulent gust.  They recoil
but hold the configuration.

						STANTZ
			Easy ... Easy ... Open the trap now!!

Spengler stomps on the foot pedal and with a loud electronic snap the long
metal box on the floor sprays up a fixed multidimensional inverted pyramid
of bright, beaded white light.

Stantz and Venkman herd the vapor to the top of the trap.

						VENKMAN
			Watch it ... Watch it ... Now!

Spengler stomps the foot pedal again.

Suddenly there is a loud double electronic snap and a blinding flash of
pink light. Wisps of brown smoke and carbonized particles rise to the
ceiling in a large residual puff. The Ghostbusters stand there for a long
moment not quite sure the battle is over.

SPENGLER

He cautiously approaches the trap end looks at the valence indicator on
it.

						SPENGLER
				(confirms it)
			He&#39;s in here.

STANTZ AND VENKMAN

They whoop in triumph -- and considerable relief.

						STANTZ
				(pulling off his slimy
				visor)
			Well!  That wasn&#39;t so bad, was it?

Venkman looks askance at him.

						VENKMAN
			Are you kidding?  That was like trying to
			push smoke into a bottle with a baseball
			bat.  Now what do we do with it?

He looks at Stantz.

STANTZ

He looks at Spengler.

SPENGLER

He shrugs.

						VENKMAN (CONT&#39;D)
				(not pleased)
			We&#39;ll have to work on that.
				(to Stantz)
			Grab that, would you, Ray?

They exit, leaving Stantz to deal with the trap.

INT. LOBBY -- NIGHT

The elevator opens and the Ghostbusters emerge.  Stantz holds the trap by
it&#39;s foot pedal.  He dangles it away from his body as if it is something
putrid.  The Hotel Manager approaches them.

						HOTEL MANAGER
			What happened?  Did you see it?  What is it?

Stantz removes his infra visor and wipes some slime off his face.  He is
beaming,

						STANTZ
			We got it!

He holds up the trap.

						HOTEL MANAGER
			What was it?  Will there be any more of them?

						STANTZ
			Sir, what you had there was what we refer
			to as a focused, non-terminal repeating
			phantasm or a Class Five Full Roaming Vapor
			... A real nasty one, too.

						VENKMAN
				(starts writing a bill)
			That&#39;ll be $4,000 for the entrapment plus
			$1,000 for proton recharge and storage.

						HOTEL MANAGER
				(shocked)
			Five thousand dollars!  I won&#39;t pay it.  I
			had no idea it would be so much.

						VENKMAN
			Fine.  We&#39;ll let it go again.
				(calls out)
			Ray!  Bring it back.

						HOTEL MANAGER
			No!  All right.  Anything.

EXT. HOTEL SEDGEWICK -- NIGHT

The Ghostbusters come through the revolving doors and see a real mob scene
on the street.  A large crowd has gathered around the Ectomobile and the
police have put up a barricade to hold them back.  Photographers are
taking pictures of it and several reporters are there waiting for them.
As the Ghostbusters cross to the vehicle, people in the crowd cheer and
the reporters start firing questions at them.

						REPORTER #1
			Nate Cohen.  I&#39;m with the Post.  What
			happened in there?

						REPORTER #2
			Did you really see a ghost?

						REPORTER #3
			Is this some kind of a stunt?

						STANTZ
				(holding up the trap;
				loudly to the crowd)
			We got one!

						REPORTER #1
			Can we see it?

						STANTZ
			Uh...I&#39;m afraid not.

						VENKMAN
			This is not a sideshow!  We&#39;re serious
			scientists.

						REPORTER #4
			What proof do you have that what you saw
			was real?

						STANTZ
			Proof?  Well, the manager of the Sedgewick
			just paid us five big ones to get something
			out of there.  Is that real enough for you?

						REPORTER #2
			Are you saying that ghosts really exist?

						VENKMAN
				(pitching)
			Not only do they exist, they&#39;re all over
			the place!  And that&#39;s why we&#39;re offering
			this vitally important service to people in
			the whole tri-state area.  We&#39;re available
			twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.
			We have the tools and we have the talent.
			No job too small, no fee too big.  We&#39;re
			ready for anything.

SPENGLER

He&#39;s confused by all the commotion and the barrage of questions from the
press. A STREET PUNK in the crowd behind the police barricades keeps
hissing at him.

						STREET PUNK
			Mister!  Hey, Mister!  Come here!  Mister.

He finally gets Spengler&#39;s attention and waves him over.

						STREET PUNK (CONT&#39;D)
			Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?

						SPENGLER
			They&#39;re not guns.  They&#39;re particle throwers.

						STREET PUNK
			Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see &#39;em.

						SPENGLER
			I couldn&#39;t do that.  You might hurt someone.

He turns away.

						STREET PUNK
			Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If
			you like shot Superman with those guns, would
			he feel it or what?

						SPENGLER
				(with authority)
			On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could
			slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.

						STREET PUNK
			Wow!

VENKMAN AND STANTZ

They are in high spirits as they continue to field questions.  A minicam
is videotaping them.

						MINICAM REPORTER
			Sing the song from your commercial.

						STANTZ
				(reluctant)
			No, we have to get back and ...

						MINICAM REPORTER
				(wheedling)
			Come on.  It&#39;s free advertising.

						VENKMAN
			There&#39;s a thought.  Hit it, Ray.

Stantz shrugs and starts singing the Ghostbusters song with embarrassed
restraint.

						STANTZ
				(singing)
			Ghostbusters ... If you have a ghost
			But you don&#39;t want to play host ...

Venkman joins in with a harmony and they continue with more confidence.

						STANTZ &amp; VENKMAN
				(singing)
			They can be bad houseguests
			And all-night pests ...
			You can&#39;t sleep at all
			So who do you call?

Spengler joins them for the big finish with no perceivable sense of melody
or rhythm.

						ALL TOGETHER
				(singing)
			Ghostbusters ... Ghostbusters.

At the moment a flashbulb goes off freezing the Ghostbusters in a
still-frame that becomes a front-page news photo.

FRONT PAGE

The New York Post carries the picture with a big headline reading:
GHOSTBUSTERS?

The Ghostbusters&#39; song really starts to cook with full production now as a
MONTAGE begins.

TELETYPE MACHINES

A bank of whirring, clicking teleprinters spits reams of hard copy and
wire service photos depicting the team at work.

						ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
			Hello, America.  This is Ronald Gwynne
			reporting from United Press International
			in New York.  Throughout my entire career
			as a journalist I have never reported
			anything as exciting and incredible as the
			trapping of an actual supernatural entity
			by a team of men based in this city who call
			themselves Ghostbusters.

INT. FIREHALL

The team hears the alarm buzzer.  They leap from their beds and slide down
the pole.

						ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (CONT&#39;D)
			Now, most of us have never even heard of a
			floating, slime-like substance called
			ectoplasm, but these gentlemen claim we will
			be seeing a lot more of it than ever before.

EXT. YANKEE STADIUM -- DAY

The Ectomobile is parked at home plate.  The Ghostbusters enter the Yankee
dugout as a concerned Groundskeeper looks on.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE -- NIGHT

The electronic Seiko sign flashes the news: Ghostbusters Nab Phantom Bat
Boy at Yankee Stadium.

FULL SCREEN VIDEO OF ROGER GRIMSBY

						ROGER GRIMSBY
			Good morning.  Today the entire Eastern
			Seaboard is alive with talk of hundreds of
			reported incidents involving multiple
			sightings in what can only be described as
			extreme events of paranormal extraphenomenical

			to bring their old ghosts and skeletons out
			of the closet.  Roy Brady reports from New
			York.

EXT. IN FRONT OF FIREHALL

Minicam set up in street.

						ROY BRADY
			Thank you, Roger.  Everybody&#39;s heard ghost
			stories around the campfire.  Heck, my
			grandma used to spin yarns about a spectral
			locomotive that used to rocket past the farm
			where she grew up.  Now, as if some unseen
			authority had suddenly given permission,
			thousands of people here are talking about
			encounters they claim to have had with ghosts.

Music and Teleclicker up.

EXT. TUDOR CITY -- DAY

The Ectomobile pulls up to a Gothic apartment building in the complex. The
Ghostbusters jump out, end hurry into the lobby.

A POLICEMAN

He notices that the Ectomobile is illegally parked and walks over to gawk
at the odd vehicle.

THE ECTOMOBILE

As the Policeman approaches, a set of double antennae on the roof are
automatically activated.  They rotate and tilt to point at the Policeman.
The Policeman is a little unnerved by the antennae and starts to walk
around the car, but the antennae follow him with unerring accuracy.

THE POLICEMAN

Eager to get away from the vehicle, he quickly writes a parking ticket and
sticks it under the windshield wiper.

THE WINDSHIELD

As the Policeman withdraws his hand, the ticket heats up, bursts into
flame and burns up.

THE POLICEMAN

He stares at the ashes for a moment then slowly backs away from the car.

INT. ECTOMOBILE -- NIGHT

Stantz is driving.  Spengler and Venkman are asleep.  They all look
completely exhausted.

THE JOE FRANKLIN SHOW -- ON CAMERA

						JOE FRANKLIN
			Ray, every time I hear about your company,
			I can&#39;t help thinking about the old Bob Hope
			movie.

						STANTZ
			Actually, Joe, the title of that film was
			&quot;Ghostbreakers,&quot; and Olsen and Johnson did
			one called &quot;Ghost Catchers&quot; and the Bowery
			Boys did &quot;Ghost Chasers,&quot; &quot;Hold That Ghost,&quot;
			&quot;Spooks Run Wild,&quot; &quot;Spook Busters,&quot; and
			&quot;Spook Chasers.&quot;

						JOE FRANKLIN
			Well, in any case, I guess there&#39;s one big
			question on everybody&#39;s mind and you&#39;re
			certainly in a position to answer it for us:
			Have you seen Elvis and how is he?

INT. RADIO STUDIO

LARRY KING is doing his phone-in talk show.

						LARRY KING
			Our phone-in topic today: Ghosts and
			Ghostbusting.  The controversy builds as more
			sightings are reported and some maintain that
			these professional paranormal eliminators in
			New York are the cause of it all.  Why did
			everything start just when these guys went
			into business?

EXT. LINCOLN CENTER -- DAY

Larry King continues voice-over as members of the New York Philharmonic
come out the stage door of Avery Fisher Hall.

						LARRY KING (V.O.)
			Should they be allowed to carry around
			unlicensed proton mass drivers?  And what&#39;s
			wrong with ghosts anyway?  Call us ... All
			our lines are open.  Hello, Larry King.

Dana is walking with another man, a VIOLINIST, when she sees Venkman
sitting on the edge of the fountain in the center of the plaza.  She asks
the Violinist to wait and crosses to Venkman.

						FEMALE CALLER (V.O.)
			Hello, Larry?  I think what Dr. Spengler
			said in his interview with you last night
			was true.  The world is in for a &quot;psychic
			shock&quot; &#39;cause like my aunt reads coffee
			grounds and she ...
				(fade out)

VENKMAN AND DANA
She is surprised and a little bit pleased to see him.

						VENKMAN
			Great rehearsal.

						DANA
			You heard it?

						VENKMAN
			You&#39;re the best one in your row.

						DANA
				(skeptical)
			Most people can&#39;t hear me with the whole
			orchestra playing.  You&#39;re good.

						VENKMAN
			I don&#39;t have to take abuse from you.  I have
			other people dying to give it to me.

						DANA
			I know.  You&#39;re quite a celebrity these
			days.  Are you here because you have info
			... about my case?

						VENKMAN
				(looks at the Violinist
				who appears to be getting
				impatient)
			Who&#39;s the stiff?

						DANA
			The &quot;stiff?&quot;  He happens to be one of the
			finest musicians in the world and a wonderful
			man.

						VENKMAN
			Is he dying or something?

They glance at the Violinist.

THE VIOLINIST

He takes a hit of nasal spray in each nostril.

DANA AND VENKMAN

She looks at him trying to decide whether she likes him or not.

						DANA
			He is a very close friend.  Do you have some
			explanation of what happened in my apartment?

						VENKMAN
			Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a
			fine restaurant.

						DANA
			Can&#39;t you tell me now?

						VENKMAN
			I&#39;ll cancel the reservation,  I found the
			name &quot;Zuul&quot; in ...
				(reading)
			The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and
			Sects.  I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;ve  read it.

						DANA
			You must have gotten the last copy.

						VENKMAN
			Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god
			worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ...
			What&#39;s that say?

						DANA
			Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the
			Sumerians.  &quot;Zuul was the Minion of Gozer.&quot;

						VENKMAN
			&quot;Gozer&quot; -- he was very big in the Sumerian
			religion.  One of their gods.

						DANA
			What&#39;s he doing in my refrigerator.

						VENKMAN
			I&#39;m checking on that.  I think we should
			meet Thursday night at nine to talk about
			it.

						DANA
			I don&#39;t think so.  I&#39;m busy Thursday night.

						VENKMAN
				(persists)
			You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to
			spend time with clients?  I&#39;m making an
			exception because I respect you as an artist
			and as a dresser.

						DANA
				(laughs)
			All right.  Since you put it that way.

						VENKMAN
			I&#39;ll pick you up at your place.  I&#39;ll bring
			along the Roylance Guide -- we can read
			after we eat.

						DANA
			I&#39;ve got to go now.

She walks toward the Violinist.  Venkman shouts after her.

						VENKMAN
			Remember.  I&#39;m the only one standing between
			you and a heavy Hittite.

She starts walking away.

						VENKMAN (CONT&#39;D)
				(calls after her)
			I&#39;ll pick you up at your place.

DANA

She waves goodbye and rejoins the Violinist,

VIOLINIST AND DANA

						VIOLINIST
				(jealous)
			Who was that?

						DANA
			Oh, he&#39;s an old professor of mine.

						VIOLINIST
				(doubtful)
			Really?

						DANA
			Yes.  He&#39;s smarter than he looks.

They walk off.

INT. RECEPTION AREA -- DAY

Janine is handling a steady barrage of phone calls, switching from one

						JANINE

			Good afternoon, GHOSTBUSTERS -- please hold.

			to you.  Thank you.

She hangs up.

						WINSTON
			Let me ask you something.  The ad in the
			paper just said &quot;Help Wanted.&quot;  What&#39;s the
			job?

						JANINE
			I really don&#39;t know, Mr. Zeddemore.  They
			just told me to take applications and ask
			you these questions.
				(she reads from a
				questionnaire as if for
				the hundredth time)
			Do you believe in U.F.O.&#39;s, astral
			projection, mental telepathy, ESP,
			clairvoyance, spirit photography,
			full-trance mediums, telekinetic movement,
			black and/or white magic, pyramidology, the
			theory of Atlantis, the Loch Ness Monster,
			or in general in spooks, spectres, wraiths,
			geists and ghosts?

						WINSTON
			Not really.  However, if there&#39;s a
			semi-regular paycheck in it I&#39;ll believe
			anything you say.

EXT. FIREHALL -- SAME TIME

A gaggle of autograph hounds is waiting on the street as Ecto One pulls
in.  The front of the building now bears a big neon sign with the
Ghostbusters logo on it.

INT. GARAGE BAY -- DAY

Venkman and Stantz disembark.  They carry a couple of traps apiece.  Their
jumpsuits are covered with smoldering ecto-slime.  The Ectomobile looks
like it&#39;s been through a war.

						STANTZ
				(exhausted)
			Boy, that was a rough one.

						VENKMAN
			I can&#39;t take much more of this.  The pace
			is killing me.

RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Venkman enters with Stantz, crosses to Janine and drops a paid invoice on
her desk.

						VENKMAN
			Here&#39;s the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She
			paid with a Visa card.

						JANINE
				(hands a sheaf of work
				orders to Stantz)
			Here are tonight&#39;s calls.

						STANTZ
				(shuffles through them)
			Oh, no.  Two more free-roaming repeaters.

						JANINE
			And this is Winston Zeddemore.  He came
			about the job.

						STANTZ
			Hi.  Ray Stantz.  Pete Venkman.

They shake hands.

						JANINE
				(to Venkman)
			And someone from the EPA is here to see you.

						VENKMAN
			The EPA?  What&#39;s he want?

						JANINE
			I didn&#39;t ask him.  All I know is that I
			haven&#39;t had a break in two weeks and you
			promised you&#39;d hire more help.

						VENKMAN
				(surly)
			Janine, I&#39;m sure a woman with your
			qualifications would have no trouble finding
			a top flight job in the housekeeping or food
			service industry.

						JANINE
			Oh, really?  Well, I&#39;ve quit better jobs
			than this one, believe me.

He exits.

STANTZ

He scans Winston&#39;s resume, ignoring the flare-up between Janine and
Venkman.  They start downstairs to the storage facility.

						STANTZ
			Very impressive resume.  Electronic
			countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ...
			Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert
			... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard,
			we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with
			streams of concentrated quantum energy and
			remove them from people&#39;s homes, offices and
			places of worship.

						WINSTON
			Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you
			really do.

INT. THE OFFICE -- SAME TIME

The walls are plastered with newspaper and magazine stories on
Ghostbusters.  WALTER PECK, junior E.P.A. administrator, is reading one of
the articles when Venkman walks in.

						VENKMAN
			Can I help you?

						PECK
				(turns all business)
			I&#39;m Walter Peck.  I represent the
			Environmental Protection Agency, Third
			District.

						VENKMAN
				(not impressed)
			Great!  How&#39;s it going?

						PECK
			Are you Peter Venkman?

						VENKMAN
			Yes, I&#39;m Doctor Venkman.

Peck looks at Venkman&#39;s soiled jumpsuit.

						PECK
			Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr.
			Venkman?

						VENKMAN
			I have Ph.D&#39;s in psychology and
			parapsychology.

						PECK
			I see.  And now you catch ghosts?

						VENKMAN
			You could say that.

						PECK
			And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr.
			Venkman?

						VENKMAN
			I&#39;m not at liberty to say.

						PECK
			And where do you put these ghosts once you
			catch them?

						VENKMAN
			In a storage facility.

						PECK
			And would this storage facility be located
			on these premises?

						VENKMAN
			Yes, it would.

						PECK
			And may I see this storage facility?

						VENKMAN
			No, you may not.

						PECK
			And why not, Mr. Venkman?

						VENKMAN
			Because you didn&#39;t say the magic word.

						PECK
				(sighs)
			And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?

						VENKMAN
			The magic word is &quot;please.&quot;

Peck laughs nervously.

						PECK
			May I please see the storage facility?

						VENKMAN
			Why do you want to see it?

						PECK
			Well, because I&#39;m curious.  I want to know
			more about what you do here.  Frankly, there
			have been a lot of wild stories in the media
			and we want to assess any possible
			environmental impact from your operation.
			For instance, the storage of noxious,
			possibly hazardous waste materials in your
			basement.  Now either you show me what&#39;s down
			there or I come back with a court order.

						VENKMAN
				(he&#39;s had it)
			Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I&#39;m
			gonna sue your ass off for wrongful
			prosecution.

						PECK
				(exiting)
			Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.

						VENKMAN
				(shouts after him)
			Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!

INT. FIREHALL BASEMENT -- SAME TIME

Spengler is at the work bench repairing a damaged proton pack. The place
is a mess with equipment, work orders, parts, catalogs and old lunches
piled everywhere. Half the room has been sealed off from floor to ceiling
with concrete blocks to form a storage facility for captured spirits.
Winston is standing at a viewing slit staring into the storage facility.

STANTZ

He inserts a trap into a metal-lined slot in the wall of the storage
facility.  Spengler crosses to a control console to assist him.

						STANTZ
				(pushing buttons)
			Set entry grid.

						SPENGLER
			Neutronize.  System shut.

He pushes more buttons and the slot lights up.  Several grating electronic
snaps are heard, like the sound of bugs being fried on an outdoor insect
light.  Then Stantz withdraws the trap and tosses it into a bin marked:
FOR RECHARGE.

						SPENGLER (CONT&#39;D)
			I&#39;ve got to sleep.

						STANTZ
			I need two new purge valves.  How&#39;s the grid
			around the storage facility holding up?

						SPENGLER
			I&#39;m worried, Ray.  It&#39;s getting crowded in
			there.  And all my recent data points to
			something big on the bottom.

						WINSTON
				(concerned)
			What do you mean &quot;big?&quot;

Spengler picks up a Hostess Twinkie from the workbench.

						SPENGLER
			Well, let&#39;s say this Twinkie represents the
			normal amount of psychokinetic energy in the
			New York area.  According to this morning&#39;s
			PKE sample, the current level in the city
			would be a Twinkie 35 feet long weighing
			approximately six hundred pounds.

						WINSTON
			That&#39;s a big Twinkie.

						STANTZ
			We could be on the verge of a fourfold
			crossover ... or worse.  If what we&#39;re
			seeing indicates a massive PKE surge, we
			could experience an actual rip.

Spengler nods gravely. Venkman enters looking very concerned.

						VENKMAN
			Egon, how&#39;s the grid around the storage
			facility holding up?

						STANTZ
			It&#39;s not good, Pete.

						WINSTON
			Tell him about the Twinkie.

Venkman lets that remark go and crosses to a TV monitor linked to a camera
inside the storage facility.

						VENKMAN
				(peering)
			I can&#39;t look anymore.  It&#39;s too depressing.

THE MONITOR.

We zoom in on the monitor and get our first real look inside the storage
facility.  It is a bleak repository for souls of many species.  Strange
lights, mists and spectral shapes waft about aimlessly.  Human-like
figures lean against the walls in despairing convict poses.  Others flit
and hang on the ceiling.  It is a sad and frightening limbo and a most
unholy makeshift asylum.

EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE -- NIGHT

A mysterious cloud takes shape and hovers over Dana&#39;s apartment building.
Then a strange glow starts to radiate from the temple-like structure on
the roof.

EXT. THE TEMPLE -- NIGHT

The moon shines through the odd cloud configuration, illuminating the
ornate temple door with its two stone Terror Dogs posed rampant on either
side of the portal.

TERROR DOG

Its hideous stone features are bathed in moonlight.  The camera PANS down
its grotesque body to one of its claws.  Suddenly there is a hiss and an
audible crack of disintegrating mortar as one of its stone talons comes to
life.

ITS HEAD

The stone figure opens its eyes, revealing glowing red pupils beneath the
scaly lids.

INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Dana gets off the elevator and immediately hears loud music blasting from
Louis&#39; apartment as his party hits full swing.  She tiptoes past his door
but despite the loudness of the music, Louis somehow senses her presence
and comes rushing out into the hall.

						LOUIS
			Oh, Dana, it&#39;s you.

						DANA
			Hi, Louis.

						LOUIS
			Hey, it&#39;s crazy in here.  You&#39;re missing a
			classic party.

						DANA
			Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming
			by.

						LOUIS
			Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better
			hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese
			and they&#39;re almost gone.  I&#39;ll make some
			more though.

						DANA
				(entering her apartment)
			Fine, Louis.  We&#39;ll stop in for a drink.

						LOUIS
			I got the Twister game for later ...

Dana closes the door leaving Louis alone in the hall, once again locked
out of his own apartment.

						LOUIS (CONT&#39;D)
				(knocking on his door)
			Hey.  Lemme in ...

INT. DANA&#39;S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

She enters and takes off her coat.  She&#39;s wearing dance clothes and
appears to be really tired.  She sits down in an overstuffed chair and
takes off her leg warmers.  Then leans back and closes her eyes.  It is
very quiet.  Something dreadful is about to happen. Then it happens. The
phone rings so loudly it makes Dana jump.  She picks it up.

						DANA
			Hello ... Oh, hi Mom.  Yes ... yes.
			Everything&#39;s fine.  No ... nothing.  Just
			that one time ... I am ... I will ... I
			won&#39;t ... Mother!  I&#39;m all right.  I told
			you.  Everything&#39;s fine ...!  All right.
			I&#39;ll talk to you tomorrow ... I promise.
			&#39;Bye.

She hangs up the phone, leans her head back and closes her eyes again.  We
hold on her for a long beat.

INT. THE KITCHEN DOOR   NIGHT

An eerie light is seen coming through the cracks around the door.

DANA

She sits up in surprise and looks at the kitchen door.

						DANA
			Oh, shit!

She starts to get up but suddenly a pair of scaly, inhuman hands rip out
of the chair cushion on either side of her and clutch her around the
waist.  She screams and tries to break their grip, but another pair of
claws tears through the upholstery and grabs her around the chest and
neck, pinning her to the chair.

THE CHAIR

As if drawn by a powerful force, the chair with Dana in it slides across
the living room floor toward the kitchen door.

THE KITCHEN DOOR

The whole door is now pulsing.

DANA

She is horrified.

THE KITCHEN DOOR

It swings open, revealing a fiery chamber where the kitchen used to be.
One of the Terror Dog creatures seen earlier in the fridge is standing
there waiting for Dana with outstretched claws.

DANA

She screams as the chair propels her into the kitchen.  Then the door
swings shut behind her.

EXT. DANA&#39;S ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

A bright flash shoots out from the center of the pyramid, lighting up the
roof of Dana&#39;s building.

ROOF TEMPLE

All is as before except that both stone Terror Dogs are ominously missing
from the structure.

INT. LOUIS&#39; APARTMENT -- SAME TIME

Louis is playing the perfect host to his clients, a general cross-section
of nerds and nerdettes,  The music is much too loud and the guests are
scattered about the living room in small groups making dull conversation.

LOUIS

He is emptying ashtrays and cleaning them with Windex.  A TALL WOMAN
approaches him.

						TALL WOMAN
			Louis, do you have any Excedrin or Extra
			Strength Tylenol?

						LOUIS
			I have acetacylasilic acid but generic from
			Walgreens cause I can get 600 tables for 35%
			less than the cost of 300 name brand.  Is it
			a headache?

The woman moves away.

THE BUFFET TABLE

Two stiff men are helping themselves. One is about to bite into some lox
when Louis joins them.

						LOUIS
			That&#39;s Nova Scotia salmon.  The real thing.
			It costs $24.95 a pound but really $12.48 a
			pound net after tax.  I&#39;m writing this whole
			party off as a promotional expense.  That&#39;s
			why I invited clients instead of friends.
			Try that Brie, it&#39;s dynamite at room
			temperature.  Maybe I should turn the heat
			up a bit ...

A SECOND WOMAN moves up to Louis.

						WOMAN #2
			C&#39;mon Louis, maybe if we dance other people
			will start.

They start to dance.

The doorbell rings.  Louis bolts for the door hoping if&#39;s Dana. It&#39;s
another couple. Louis escorts them in and take, their coats.

						LOUIS
			Everybody, this is Ted and Annette Fleming.
			Ted has a small carpet cleaning business in
			receivership, but Annette is drawing a
			salary from a deferred bonus from two years
			ago and the house has $15,000 left at eight
			percent.

He goes to the bedroom door with their coats and opens it.

INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT

On the bed, standing up on all four legs, is a bristling, panting, live
Terror Dog.  Too preoccupied to notice it, Louis reflexively tosses the
coats onto the bed. They both land on the Terror Dog&#39;s head.

INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Louis comes out of the bedroom and closes the door.  Then from within
there issues forth a tremendous roar that freezes the quest.

						LOUIS
			Okay.  Who brought the dog?

BEDROOM DOOR

An instant later, the Terror Dog bursts right through the door.  Wood
chips and splinters shower the guests.

THE GUESTS

They drop their drinks and canapes as the Terror Dog lands in the center
of the room, snarling hellishly.

It quickly scans the room, looking for Louis.

LOUIS

He yelps and runs for the door.

TERROR DOG

He lunges after Louis, but Louis gets out just in time and slams the door
behind him.

INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Louis tears off down the hall, bellowing. The Terror Dog bursts through
the door, lands in the hall and runs after him.

Louis ducks into the elevator.

EXT, DANA&#39;S BUILDING NIGHT

A DOORMAN stands at his post near the revolving door,  Two elegantly
dressed visitors wait as he phones to announce them to one of the building
residents. Suddenly Louis comes running out of the door.

						LOUIS
			Help! Help!  There&#39;s a bear loose in my
			apartment.

He runs across the street and disappears in the park.

THE DOORMAN

						DOORMAN
				(mutters)
			How he&#39;s got animals up there.

The Doorman turns just in time to see the Terror Dog before it runs right
over him and bounds across the street.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK

TWO BUMS stroll casually along discussing current events.

						FIRST BUM
			I think you&#39;re right about Central America
			but I completely disagree about the other
			thing.  A good heavyweight boxer could take
			a Karate guy every time.

Louis runs by them, almost knocking them over.

						LOUIS
				(screaming)
			Run!  Run!

They turn to watch him go.

						SECOND BUM
				(shaking his head)
			Rush, rush, rush.

They turn back just as the Terror Dog streaks past them in hot pursuit.
They recoil in fear and watch as the creature sprints after Louis.

						SECOND BUM (CONT&#39;D)
			That is one speedy mutt.

						FIRST BUM
			He&#39;s a big one.  You don&#39;t want to mess with
			that particular breed.

						SECOND BUM
			Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I
			think.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

Louis runs for his life, afraid to look back.  He races through a tunnel
then sees the twinkling lights of the Tavern on the Green restaurant and
heads straight for it.

EXT. TAVERN ON THE GREEN -- NIGHT

Louis comes tearing into the courtyard of the restaurant.  Through the
large picture windows he can see well-dressed people sitting in the
elegant dining room.  He goes for a door into the dining room but finds it
locked. Then he tries another door but it, too, is locked.  Suddenly, he
hears a low rumbling growl from the bushes. Desperate now, he starts
pounding on the glass.

INT. TAVERN ON THE GREEN -- SAME TIME

The wealthy patrons look up and see Louis pounding on the glass, screaming
unintelligibly.

						LOUIS
				(muffled)
			Help!  Help!

They ignore his pleas and return to their salmon croute.

EXT. COURTYARD -- NIGHT

Louis&#39; heart is pounding, his breath coming in compulsive gasps as he
turns to face the relentless Terror Dog.

THE TERROR DOG

It stands there silhouetted in the dark.  Then it starts advancing toward
Louis, casting giant shadows on the walls.

LOUIS

He is paralyzed with fear.

						LOUIS
				(trembling)
			Nice doggie.  Nice.

THE TERROR DOG

It pounces with a tremendous roar.

INT. TAVERN ON THE GREEN -- NIGHT

The roar echoes through the restaurant.  There is the sound of a violent
struggle, then all is quiet.  Nobody notices.

COLUMBUS CIRCLE   LATER

Louis walks out of the park, walking stiffly with a glazed look in his
eyes.  He sees a horse and carriage parked at the curb.  He goes right up
to the horse and speaks to it, obviously possessed by the Terror Dog.

						LOUIS
				(to the horse)
			I am Vinz Clortho.  Keymaster of Gozer,
			Volguus Zildrohar, Lord of the Sebouillia.
			Are you the Gatekeeper?

The COACHMAN sees Louis talking to his horse.

						COACHMAN
			Hey!  He pulls the wagon.  I make the deals.
			You wanna ride?

						LOUIS
				(to Coachman)
			Are you the Gatekeeper?

						COACHMAN
			No, I&#39;m the Governor of New Jersey.  Now get
			outta here.

Louis glares at the Coachman. His eyes begin to glow, magically.

						LOUIS
				(to Coachman)
			You will perish in flames, subcreature!
			Gozer will destroy you and your kind!
				(he whispers to the horse)
			Wait for the sign.  Then all prisoners will
			be released.

Louis lopes off across the street.  The cars come screeching to a halt to
avoid hitting him.

THE STREET

TWO MOUNTED POLICEMEN notice his strange behavior and follow him down the
street.

EXT. DANA&#39;S APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT

Venkman enters dressed neatly in a suit, holding a bouquet of flowers for
Dana. He sees two COPS talking to dishevelled party guests.  He sidles up
to one of the cops.

						VENKMAN
			What&#39;s going on?

						THE COP
			Some moron brought a cougar to a party and
			it went berserk,

						VENKMAN
			Oh.

He goes to the elevators.

INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Venkman walks past Louis&#39; apartment and curiously notes the splintered
door.  Then he rings Dana&#39;s bell, waits, rings again and knocks.

						VENKMAN
				(calls out)
			Dana?

The door opens and Dana is standing there, but she has changed radically
from the woman we met earlier.   Her hair is down, flowing loosely over
her naked shoulders, her eyes are wide open, filled with a kind of
love-slave longing, her lips are parted and wet and her clothes are
seductively tattered.  She stares at Venkman.

						VENKMAN (CONT&#39;D)
			Hi.
				(he notes the change in
				her)
			What happened to you? The cop downstairs
			said an animal got loose up here.  What&#39;s
			the story?  Are you all right?

She stares at him as if she hasn&#39;t heard a word he said.

						DANA
			Are you the Keymaster?

Venkman realizes that something bizarre has happened.

						VENKMAN
			Not that I know of.

She starts to close the door but Venkman slides past her into the
apartment.

						VENKMAN (CONT&#39;D)
				(worried now)
			Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?

						DANA
			I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.

He looks around the apartment and notices the holes ripped in the chair.
Then he sees the kitchen doorframe charred and blackened with soot.

						VENKMAN
			I think we better get out of here.

DANA

She crosses to the window and gazes at the sky as if waiting for
something.

						DANA
			We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.

						VENKMAN
				(humoring her)
			Okay, I&#39;ll help you.  Should we make some
			dip or something?

						DANA
			He is the Destructor.

						VENKMAN
			Really?  Can&#39;t wait to meet him.
				(he has an idea)
			As long as we&#39;re waiting for him, I&#39;d really
			like to try something with you -- in the
			bedroom.

He takes her hand and she yields.  They enter the bedroom.

INT. DANA&#39;S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

They enter and Venkman steers her onto the bed.

						DANA
				(wantonly)
			Do you want this body?

						VENKMAN
				(taking her pulse)
			Well, I&#39;ll just use it for a while and get
			it right back to you.

						DANA
			Take me now.

He checks her pupil dilation with a penlight.

						VENKMAN
			Well, I make it a rule never to sleep with
			possessed people.

She pulls him down on top of her and kisses him with supernatural lust.

						VENKMAN
				(coming up for air)
			Actually, it&#39;s more of a policy than a rule.

						DANA
				(stroking him)
			I want you inside me.

						VENKMAN
				(reluctant)
			I don&#39;t know.  You&#39;ve got two people in
			there already.  It could get a little
			crowded.
				(he gently pushes her back
				down on the bed)
			I want you to close your eyes and relax.
				(she complies)
			Now I&#39;m going to speak to Dana and I want
			Dana to answer.

						DANA
			I am Zuul.  I am ...

						VENKMAN
			Right ... You&#39;re the Gatekeeper.  But I want
			Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...

						DANA
				(in a low, horrible
				unearthly voice)
			There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.

						VENKMAN
				(recoils)
			Whoa!! Nice voice.

She starts to sit up, but he restrains her with a light touch on the
shoulder.

						VENKMAN (CONT&#39;D)
				(trying another approach)
			All right -- Zuul.  Listen carefully.  I
			don&#39;t know where you came from or why, but
			I want you to get out of here and leave Dana
			alone.  I&#39;m going to count to ten and when
			I&#39;m finished, you better be gone.  Okay?
			Here goes.  One ... Two ... Three ...

A shudder runs through Dana&#39;s body, then she slowly starts to levitate,
rising a full three feet off the bed.

						VENKMAN (CONT&#39;D)
				(aghast)
			Wow!

He stands up and circles around the bed looking for some sort of
explanation.  He passes his hands over her, then under her, looking for
wires or a force field.  Then he makes a few theatrical moves like a cheap
magician.

EXT. HUDSON PARKWAY -- SAME NIGHT

Ecto One speeds northward, strobes lit.

INT. ECTOMOBILE -- NIGHT

Winston is at the wheel.  Stantz pops open a beer and lights a smoke. They
both look completely wasted. Stantz is looking over some blueprints.

						WINSTON
			Hey man.  What is it you&#39;re so involved with
			there?

						STANTZ
			Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the
			structural ironwork in Dana Barrett&#39;s
			apartment building ... And they&#39;re most
			unusual.

						WINSTON
				(changing the subject)
			Are you a Christian, Ray?

						STANTZ
				(examining documents)
			Mmmhmmm.

						WINSTON
			Me, too.

						STANTZ
				(reacting to something in
				the blueprint)
			Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.

						WINSTON
			Do you believe in God?

						STANTZ
			No.  But I liked Jesus&#39; style.

						WINSTON
			Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.

						STANTZ
				(hardly listening)
			The whole roof cap was fabricated with a
			magnesium-tungsten alloy.

						WINSTON
			Ray, do you remember something in the Bible
			about a day when the dead would rise up from
			their graves?

						STANTZ
				(still absorbed by the
				blueprint)
			And the seas would boil ...

						WINSTON
			Right.  And the sky would fall ...

						STANTZ
			Judgement Day ...

						WINSTON
			Yeah, Judgement Day.

						STANTZ
			Every ancient religion had its own myth
			about the end of the world.

						WINSTON
			Well, has it ever occurred to you that the
			reason you&#39;ve been so busy lately is because
			the dead have been rising from their graves?

They exchange a look of puzzlement and concern.

EXT.. FORT DETMERRING -- NIGHT -- SAME TIME

Ecto One pulls up to a pair of massive parapets and a hewn timber gate set
in a thick redoubt on an escarpment high above the river. Two figures
approach them from the shadows.  As they draw closer, Stantz and Winston
see their Stetson hats and uniforms.

						PARK RANGER
			Evening.  We&#39;ve had a problem here for quite
			some time.  I called your outfit a couple of
			weeks ago.

						WINSTON
			Busy time of year.

						PARK RANGER
			Nobody likes to talk about this sort of thing.

						STANTZ
			You don&#39;t have to worry about that with us,
			sir.

						WINSTON
			Right.  We&#39;ll believe anything.

INT. FORT -- GUNNER&#39;S CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

Stantz and Winston walk past a long line of cannon.  Their visors are
down.  They wear the usual equipment.

						STANTZ
			You check the armory.  I&#39;ll go down to the
			officers&#39; barracks.

They split up. Winston takes a long, low passageway. Stantz descends a set
of stone stairs.  They both leave frame.  The sound of their separate
footsteps fades O.S.

EXT. FIREHALL -- NIGHT -- SAME TIME

A police van pulls up, the garage door opens and Spengler comes out of the
building.  He meets a POLICE SERGEANT.  They walk around to the back door
of the van.

						SERGEANT
			We picked up this guy and now we don&#39;t know
			what to do with him, Bellevue doesn&#39;t want
			him and I&#39;m afraid to put him in the
			lock-up.  I&#39;m telling you, there&#39;s something
			weird about him.  And I know you guys are
			into this stuff so we figured we&#39;d check
			with you.

The Sergeant unlocks the door and pulls it open.

INT. THE POLICE VAN -- NIGHT

Louis is on the floor wearing a strait jacket.  He is tied to the bench
with leather restraint straps and ankle cuffs.

						LOUIS
				(forlorn)
			Are you the Gatekeeper?

Spengler notes the strange glow in Louis&#39; eyes,

						SPENGLER
			Bring him inside, Officer.

INT. BASEMENT -- LATER

Louis is hooked up to a variety of strange contraptions including
something on his head that looks like an aluminum mixing bowl wired with
hundreds of electrodes.  Spengler monitors Louis&#39; reactions as he
questions him. Janine watches.

						LOUIS
			I am Vinz Clortho - Keymaster of Gozer.

						SPENGLER
				(reacts to the name Gozer)
			I am Egon Spengler, Creature of Earth,
			Doctor of Physics, Graduate of M.I.T.

						JANINE
				(looking through Louis&#39;
				wallet)
			According to this his name is Louis Tully.

						LOUIS
			Oh, no.  Tully is the fleshbag I&#39;m using.
			I must wait inside for the sign.

						JANINE
			Do you want some coffee while you&#39;re waiting?

						LOUIS
				(to Spengler)
			Do I?

						SPENGLER
			Yes, have some.
				(Janine goes to the table
				and puts some water up to
				boil)
			Vinz, what sign are you waiting for?

						LOUIS
			Gozer the Traveller will come in one of the
			pre-chosen forms.  During the rectification
			of the Vuldronaii the Traveller came as a
			very large and moving Torb.  Then of course
			in the third reconciliation of the last of
			the Meketrex supplicants they chose a new
			form for him, that of a Sloar.  Many Shubs
			and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in
			the depths of the Sloar that day I can tell
			you.

Spengler stares at Louis for a moment then looks over at Janine.

JANINE

She rolls her eyes at Spengler and mimes the traditional sign for lunacy
by pointing to her temple and tracing a circle with her index finger.
Then the phone rings and Spengler answers it.

						SPENGLER
			Hello?

INT. DANA&#39;S BEDROOM -- SAME TIME

Venkman is lying on the bed with the phone.  Dana is asleep next to him,
still floating three feet in the air with a blanket over her.

						VENKMAN
			It&#39;s Peter, Egon.  I&#39;ve got a problem.

INTERCUT SPENGLER AND VENKMAN

						SPENGLER
			What is it?

						VENKMAN
			I&#39;m with Dana Barrett and she&#39;s floating
			three feet off the bed.

						SPENGLER
			Does she want to be?

						VENKMAN
			I don&#39;t think so.  It&#39;s more of that Gozer
			thing.  She says she&#39;s the Gatekeeper.  Does
			that make any sense to you?

						SPENGLER
			Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He&#39;s here
			with me now.
				(there&#39;s a long silence
				on the other end)
			Venkman?  Are you there?

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It
			probably wouldn&#39;t be a good idea for them
			to get together at this point.

						SPENGLER
			I agree.

						VENKMAN
			You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you
			have to, but don&#39;t let him leave,  He could
			be very dangerous.

SPENGLER

He looks nervously at Louis.

LOUIS

He pours some instant coffee crystals into his mouth and chews them up,
then he drinks a beaker of boiling water that&#39;s been heating over a Bunsen
Burner.

						SPENGLER
				(into the phone)
			All right.  I&#39;ll try.

						VENKMAN
			I&#39;ll spend the night here and get back first
			thing in the morning.

						SPENGLER
			All right, Peter.  Good night.

They hang up.

JANINE

She crosses to Spengler.

						JANINE
				(worried)
			Egon, there&#39;s something very strange about
			that man.
				(she indicates Louis)
			I&#39;m very psychic usually and right now I
			have this terrible feeling that something
			awful is going to happen to you.  I&#39;m afraid
			you&#39;re going to die.

						SPENGLER
			Die in what sense?

						JANINE
			In the physical sense.

						SPENGLER
			I don&#39;t care.  I see us as tiny parts of a
			vast organism, like two bacteria living on
			a rotting speck of dust floating in an
			infinite void.

						JANINE
			That&#39;s so romantic.

She hugs him, Spengler responds awkwardly, not sure where to put his
hands.

						SPENGLER
				(nervous)
			You have nice clavicles.
				(he gulps)
			I wonder where Stantz is.  I think we&#39;re
			going to need him.

INT. FORT DETMERRING -- SINGLE OFFICERS&#39; QUARTERS -- NIGHT

Stantz is in a painstakingly restored period room with a four poster bed,
writing table and wardrobe hung with uniforms.  His own jumpsuit and
backpack lie in a heap beside the bed.  He fingers an officer&#39;s uniform
then tries it on. He steps to a full-length mirror and models it, striking
a few heroic poses. He shrugs, sits on the bed, bouncing the mattress and
squeezing it.  He then lies down full length and tests it, hands behind
his head.

STANTZ

He yawns.  His eyes droop, blink and finally close.  His head lolls
sideways, his mouth drops open slightly and he drops off to sleep,
exhausted.

INT. WARDROBE -- NIGHT

A uniform sleeve moves slightly. A sabre in its sheath begins to tap
lightly against the open doorsash.  A phosphorescent light streaks out in
between gaps in the clothing, casting patterns over the room.

STANTZ&#39; PACK AND WANDS

A panel light winks on.  The needle on his PKE meter jumps into the red.

STANTZ

He rolls over.  From inside the wardrobe a shimmering pink mist rises up
and begins to take form on the ceiling.

MIST

The vaguest remnants of a human form take shape.  It hovers and shifts as
if appraising Stantz,

STANTZ

He tosses and rolls onto his back, still deeply asleep.

BED CANOPY

The mist slithers in through the curtains and takes a position above him.
It begins to descend slowly.

STANTZ

The mist widens and elongates and sprawls in suspension over his body. He
wakes. The apparition is inches above his face.  He gasps but can&#39;t move,
totally transfixed with fear.

STANTZ&#39; POV

He is face-to-face with a lost soul.  It is a beautiful feminine face. It
presses in closer. He sucks in his breath.  Is he being smothered?  The
gaunt figure then slides slowly away from his face and down to a spot
below his waist.

STANTZ

He props himself up on his elbows and looks down.  Suddenly the apparition
vanishes.  Then his belt comes undone as if pulled by an invisible hand
and his zipper slowly opens.

CLOSE-UP -- STANTZ&#39; FACE

His look changes from fear to confusion to pleasure.  He closes his eyes
and submits.

INT. BARRACKS CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

Winston is smoking a cigarette, ambling down the barracks corridor.  He
hears voices and walks to the door of the barracks.

						WINSTON
			Stantz?  You okay in there?

						STANTZ
				(from inside)
			LATER, MAN!!

Winston shrugs and slinks out.

EXT. FIREHALL -- MORNING

Two cars pull up out front, a New York City Police car and a lime green
K-car with U.S. Government plates.  They are followed by a Con Edison
utilities van and a County Sheriff&#39;s car. Peck gets out of the government
car.  Two COPS step out and flank him.   A POLICE CAPTAIN joins them and
they all enter the firehall.

INT. FIREHALL -- RECEPTION AREA

Janine is at her desk when the law enters and walks right past her.

						PECK
				(heading for the basement)
			This way, Captain.

						JANINE
				(rushes over to block
				their way)
			I beg your pardon!  Just where do you think
			you&#39;re going?

						PECK
			Step aside, Miss, or I&#39;ll have you arrested
			for interfering with a police officer.

						JANINE
				(not moving)
			Who do you think you&#39;re talking to, Mister?
			Do I look like a child?  You can&#39;t come in
			here without some kind of warrant or writ or
			something.

Peck hands her the court orders.

						PECK
				(naming them)
			Cease and desist all commerce order, seizure
			of premises and chattels, ban on the use of
			public utilities for non-licensed waste
			handlers and a Federal Entry and Inspection
			Order.

						JANINE
				(steps aside)
			This is just like Poland.

Peck brushes past her and leads his cohorts toward the basement.

INT. BASEMENT -- LATER

Spengler is arguing with Peck.  Louis is sitting quietly in the corner,
watching the argument with interest.

						PECK
				(high-handed)
			I want to see what&#39;s in there.  Now either
			you shut off those &quot;beams&quot; or we&#39;ll shut
			them off for you.

						SPENGLER
				(calmly)
			You can see what&#39;s inside through the
			monitor if you wish.

He switches it on.

						PECK
				(ignores it)
			I&#39;m not interested in TV right now.

EXT. FIREHALL

Venkman arrives in a taxi, sees the police cars parked outside and dashes
in.

INT. BASEMENT

The argument is still going on when Venkman enters and asserts himself.

						VENKMAN
				(to Policemen)
			At ease, Officers.  I&#39;m Peter Venkman.  I
			think there&#39;s been some kind of
			misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate
			in every way I can.

						PECK
				(turns on him immediately)
			Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to
			cooperate but you thought it was more fun to
			insult me.  Now it&#39;s my turn, smart-ass.

						SPENGLER
				(excited)
			He wants to shut down the storage grid.

						VENKMAN
			If you turn that thing off we won&#39;t be
			responsible for the consequences.

						PECK
			On the contrary!  You will be held
			completely responsible.
				(to the Con-Ed Man)
			Turn it off.

The CON-ED MAN steps to the control panel and looks at the switches,
meters and chasing lights.

						VENKMAN
				(to the Con-Ed Man)
			Don&#39;t do it!  I&#39;m warning you.

THE CON-ED MAN

He looks nervously at the Police Captain.

						CON-ED MAN
			I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before.
			I don&#39;t know ...

						PECK
				(enraged)
			Just do it, fella.  Nobody asked for your
			opinion.

The Con-Ed Man reaches for a switch but Venkman grabs him from behind.

						VENKMAN
				(to the Con-Ed Man)
			Don&#39;t be a jerk!

The Cops grab Venkman and drag him off the Con-Ed Man.

						PECK
			If he tries that again, shoot him.

The Captain looks at Peck with contempt.

						CAPTAIN
				(to Peck)
			You do your job, pencil-neck.  Don&#39;t tell
			us how to do ours.

						VENKMAN
			Thank you, Officer.

						PECK
				(to Con-Ed Man)
			Now turn it off.

The Cops slacken their hold on Venkman. He looks at Spengler, worried.

SPENGLER

He mimes an explosion with his hands.

VENKMAN

He nods and backs towards the door.  Spengler gets the same thought.

LOUIS

He sees Spengler backing away and starts to do the same.

CONTROL PANEL

The Con-Ed Man turns all the switches to the OFF position.  The panel
lights go out.

POWER METER

The needle indicator drops to zero.

PECK

He feels the floor start to shake.

VENKMAN, SPENGLER AND LOUIS

They run like crazy for the stairs. Spengler grabs Janine on the way out.

THE STORAGE FACILITY

A strange light starts to leak through the cracks between the concrete
blocks.  Suddenly one of the blocks is blown across the room.

EXT. THE FIREHALL

Everyone comes running out as the storage facility explodes.  A powerful
geyser of irridescent energy shoots out the top of the building like a
phenomenal Roman Candle reaching a hundred feet in the air.

INT. DANA&#39;S BEDROOM -- THAT INSTANT

As the explosion rumbles in the distance, Dana&#39;s eyes pop open as if cued
by the blast.

EXT. FIREHALL -- SAME TIME

Venkman, Spengler and the others are dodging and ducking a shower of
debris.

LOUIS

He stands there oblivious to the danger, looking up at the glowing geyser
of energy.  Janine is beside him.

						LOUIS
			It is time.  This is the sign.

						JANINE
			It&#39;s a sign, all right ... &quot;Going Out Of
			Business.&quot;

Louis walks off down the street as if in the grip of some powerful psychic
compulsion.  The others are too busy to notice his departure.

EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN

A wide shot of the island shows the glistening geyser spurting high into
the air.  The irridescent cloud, generated by the geyser starts moving
across Manhattan toward Dana&#39;s building. Sirens are screaming all over
town as police cars, fire trucks and emergency vehicles race to the scene.

EXT. FIREHALL -- LATER

Firetrucks, police cars, Con-Ed trucks and a general mob are assembled,
watching the roof of the building which is spurting a translucent blue
substance. It looks like a massive natural gas flame. Bits of ecto
material rain down on the on-lookers.

SPENGLER

Flanked by police, he tries to answer questions from fire department
officials and a hazardous chemical EXPERT in a bulky decontamination suit.

						GUY IN SUIT
			... does it contain TCE, PCB or tailings
			from styrene esters or any polyfluoric
			groups...?

						FIRE CAPTAIN
			What are the pink particles?  What will
			happen if we use water?

Spengler just shakes his head.

						SPENGLER
			No ... no water.  There&#39;s nothing you can do.

						FIRE CAPTAIN
			Did you have any kind of solvents or any
			concentrated sulphurs of any kind?

Ecto One pulls up. Winston and Stantz jump out. Stantz finds Venkman and
Spengler.

						STANTZ
			What happened??!!!?

						SPENGLER
			The storage facility blew.  This one ...
				(indicates Peck)
			... shut off the protection grid.

VENKMAN

Suddenly remembers another problem.

						VENKMAN
				(to Spengler)
			Where&#39;s the Keymaster?

						SPENGLER
				(looks for Louis)
			Oh, shit!

						STANTZ
				(at a loss)
			Who&#39;s the Keymaster?

Spengler looks at Venkman.  They both tear off to find Louis but Peck
intervenes.

						PECK
				(to a Cop)
			Stop them!  I want them arrested, Captain.
			These men have been acting in criminal
			violation of the Environmental Protection
			Act and this explosion was a direct result.

The Police Captain restrains Venkman from leaving.

						VENKMAN
				(shouts at Peck)
			You turned off the power!
				(to Captain)
			Look, there was another man here ... You
			have to find him and bring him back.  A
			short determined-looking guy with the eyes
			of a happy zombie.

						PECK
				(to the Cop)
			See!  They are using drugs.

Spengler turns on Peck with uncharacteristic fury.

						SPENGLER
			If you don&#39;t shut up I&#39;m going to rip out
			your septum.

Peck backs off.

						POLICE CAPTAIN
				(exasperated)
			I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on here but I&#39;m
			going to have to arrest you all.  You can
			discuss it with the judge.  I&#39;m going to
			read you your rights now, so please listen
			carefully ...

EXT. THE BOWERY

Louis walks briskly and purposefully uptown, gazing at the symmetrical
lights in the sky.

SUBWAY ENTRANCE

As Louis walks by, a huge crowd of people descends the stairs into the
subway.  The last of them disappears around the corner.  Then echoing
screams are heard and the whole crowd comes charging back up the stairs
pursued by a strange apparition.

INT. DANA&#39;S APARTMENT

She is standing at the open bedroom window gazing down into the streets
below.

EXT. SEDGEWICK HOTEL -- SAME TIME

A Sabrett HOT DOG VENDOR is dispensing pretzels and hot dogs from his
pushcart.

THE VENDOR

He opens the top of the bin and reaches in to get a bun.  He feels around
inside, knowing the cart should be loaded with food.  Then he peers inside
and yanks his arm out with a shout.  He falls back in fear.

THE CART

The gluttonous Onion-Headed Vapor rises out of the pushcart stuffed with
hot dogs, buns and pretzels.  It belches loudly at the gaping spectators,
then flits down the street with the pushcart following under its own
power.

EXT. EXXON BUILDING -- SAME TIME

A well-dressed BUSINESSMAN comes rushing out and jumps into a cab parked
at the curb.

INT.. THE BACK SEAT

The Businessman leans close to the safety partition and shouts his
destination.

						BUSINESSMAN
			Gulf and Western Building!  And I&#39;m in a
			hurry so let&#39;s not dawdle.

THE FRONT SEAT

Through the windshield we see that the driver is a badly decomposed corpse
in a leather jacket and snap-brim cap.

THE PASSENGER

Through the partition he sees a skeletal hand reach out and start the
meter.

EXT. THE STREET

The cab peels away from the curb at tremendous speed and turns the wrong
way up a one-way street.

INT. AN OFFICE - SAME TIME

It&#39;s the accounts department of a major corporation.  Young men and women
are working at typewriters and computer terminals in the sterile, modern
office.

A PROGRAMMER

She bends over at the file cabinets and something gooses her.  She looks
around, miffed, but sees no one.  She goes back to her desk.  Her skirt
hikes up suddenly.  She yanks it back down. Then she feels a strange, not
unpleasant tickling under her. She squirms. Her skirt goes up again. The
tickling gets unbearable, forcing her to stand. She walks briskly between
the rows of desks, trying to get to the ladies room, fighting to keep her
skirt down.  Her co-workers begin to notice and laugh.

A TYPIST

She stands up to look and her blouse pops open.

THE OFFICE

All the women begin to scream and squirm as the invisible molester runs
wild in the office.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- SAME TIME

Louis enters a long dark pedestrian tunnel.

INSIDE THE TUNNEL

A gang of MUGGERS is smoking something in a weird pipelike device. One of
them sees the approaching silhouette of Louis and hisses to his cohorts.
The others all look and slowly begin to fan out across the width of the
tunnel.

LOUIS

He is staring straight ahead and entirely focused on his destination as
the muggers approach and confront him.  He stops.  They are deliberately
blocking his path.

						MUGGER
				(to Louis)
			Okay ... give me.

Louis blinks stupidly.

						LOUIS
			Are you the Gatekeeper?

						MUGGER
			Come on.  You want me to stick you?  Come
			on.

						VINZ
			I am Vinz Clortho.  I am the Keymaster.  Do
			you bar my way?

						MUGGER #2
			Are you crazy, man?  You don&#39;t give, Jino&#39;s
			gonna rip you, man.  Nobody gets by Jino.

						LOUIS
				(repeats)
			Do you bar my way?

						MUGGER
			Yeah.  We bar your way.

LOUIS

His eyes widen, he inhales deeply, then opens his mouth and roars.
Irridescent lights pour out of his mouth.

THE MUGGERS

They scream and run, horrified and disgusted by Louis&#39; unearthly display.

EXT. STREET

The cab driven by the corpse weaves through traffic at breakneck speed.
Cars are forced up on the curb. Pedestrians run for safety.

INT. THE BACK SEAT

The Businessman is reading the Wall Street Journal, oblivious to the whole
situation.

EXT. ST. MARKS PLAYHOUSE -- DAY

A worn, graffiti-spattered $1.99 triple bill movie house in the New Wave
district near Second Avenue.  The bill reads:

			ALL NIGHT ALL DAY HORROR SHOW IN 3-D

INT. THEATER

The house is packed with hooting, jeering, beer-drinking potsmoking
downtowners, all wearing cardboard 3-D glasses. They are wildly razzing
and throwing things at the screen on which is running a bad sixties
British horror indie pic.  The film breaks. The sound crackles off and the
lights come on. There is a storm of protest and abuse hurled at the
projectionist.  Then from all around them there starts a thin whistling
whine.  It builds above the shouts and jeers in the theater until everyone
stops to hear what it is. It is like no other sound ever heard -- a
piercing, all-permeating shrill whistle like the fan blades of some
massive unseen turbine beginning to rotate.

The lights in the theater flicker. The musty ancient curtains on either
side of the screen are picked up in an unseen wind which lifts them,
spreading dust and ripped old fabric about the house.  There are shouts
and sounds and noises from deep beyond the recesses of the backstage.  The
curtains are now flying in a serious wind.  All the lights in the theater
go out except that from the projection booth.  From a point in the center
of the screen, a searing bolt of phosphorescent light rips back along the
projection beam into the booth.  The beam evolves into an etheric strand
of unified glistening particles.  The wind dies down.  People in the house
are hushed.  They gaze transfixed as a procession of phantasms emerge in
single file through the illuminated screen.  As if suspended on a
clothesline, they weave and bounce along the length of the pulsating beam,
and pass through the hole in the projection booth.  The apparition is
gone. All is quiet.  Then the audience bursts into wildly enthusiastic
applause.

INT. NYPD LOCK-UP

Winston is staring out through the bars talking to himself.

						WINSTON
				(depressed)
			We&#39;re gonna get five years for this.  Plus
			they&#39;re gonna make us retrap all those
			spooks.  I knew I shouldn&#39;t have taken this
			job.

He bangs on the bars and crosses to Venkman, Stantz and Spengler who are
huddled together looking at blueprints of Dana&#39;s building.

						STANTZ
				(intense)
			Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It
			looks exactly like the kind of telemetry
			tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars
			in other galaxies.

						SPENGLER
			And look at this, Peter
				(indicates another diagram)
			Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.

Venkman leans in to look but suddenly notices that they have an audience.

THE CELL

The Ghostbusters are surrounded by a motley assortment of BUMS, PUNKS,
HOODS and a particularly mean-looking gang of BIKERS, all listening
intently to their discussion.

						VENKMAN
				(to their cellmates)
			Everybody with us so far?

The other prisoners mutter and scratch their heads, then drift off.

						STANTZ
				(back to his point)
			The ironwork extends down through fifty feet
			of bedrock and touches the water table!

He looks at Venkman who doesn&#39;t see the significance.

						VENKMAN
				(shrugs)
			I guess they don&#39;t build them like they used
			to, huh?

						STANTZ
			No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The
			architect was either an authentic whacko or
			a certified genius.  The whole building is
			like a huge antenna for pulling in and
			concentrating psychokinetic energy.

						VENKMAN
			Who was the architect?

						STANTZ
			He&#39;s listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.

						SPENGLER
				(exclaims)
			Of course!
				(the others turn and look
				at him)
			Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin&#39;s
			SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society
			in 1920.

						VENKMAN
				(putting it all together)
			Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.

						SPENGLER
			Yes.  After the First World War Shandor
			decided that society was too sick to
			survive.  And he wasn&#39;t alone.  He had close
			to a thousand followers when he died.  They
			conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended
			to bring about the end of the world.

						VENKMAN
				(now very worried about
				Dana)
			She said he was &quot;the Destructor.&quot;

						SPENGLER
			Who?

						VENKMAN
			Gozer.

						SPENGLER
				(confused)
			You talked to Gozer?

						VENKMAN
			Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to
			Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as
			the Destructor.

						STANTZ
				(proud)
			See?  I told you something big was about to
			happen.

Winston has heard enough.

						WINSTON
			This is insane!  You actually believe that
			some moldy Babylonian God is going to drop
			in at 78th and Central Park West and start
			tearing up the city?

						SPENGLER
				(corrects him)
			Sumarian -- not Babylonian,

Winston just shakes his head. Then a uniformed GUARD appears with a
high-ranking POLICE OFFICIAL and unlocks the cell door.

						POLICE OFFICIAL
			Are you the Ghostbusters?

						VENKMAN
			What about it?

						POLICE OFFICIAL
			The  mayor wants to see you -- right away.
			The whole island is going crazy.  Let&#39;s go.

They exit.

EXT. CITY HALL

The official cars arrive and the Ghostbusters are hustled past a mob of
reporters, all shouting questions at once.

						REPORTERS
				(as babble)
			Are you under arrest?  Did you have a bomb
			factory in the basement?  What are you going
			to do about all these ghosts?

INT. MAYOR&#39;S OFFICE

Secretaries and aides scurry about in a chaos of telephones and waiting
city officials.  As the Ghostbusters are led through the outer offices,
everyone stops what they&#39;re doing to stare at them.

INT. OFFICE OF THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY

The Ghostbusters enter and see a very concerned group of leaders arguing
like crazy. The Police and Fire Commissioners, State and City Police
Commandants, the Archbishop of the New York Diocese, the Regional Director
of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Governor of the State of New
York, and various other high-ranking officials.

						THE AIDE
				(entering with the
				Ghostbusters)
			The Ghostbusters are here, Mr. Mayor.

At once, the group turns and instantly regains perfect decorum.

THE MAYOR

He is a likeable Democrat and a man of the people -- particularly the
Irish, Italian and Jewish people.

						MAYOR
				(looking them over)
			Okay, the Ghostbusters.  And who&#39;s Peck?

Peck shoulders his way forward.

						PECK
				(adrenalin pumping)
			I&#39;m Walter Peck, sir.  And I&#39;m prepared to
			make a full report.
				(holds up dossier)
			These men are complete snowball artists.
			They use nerve and sense gases to induce
			hallucinations.  The people think they&#39;re
			seeing ghosts and call these bozos, who
			conveniently show up to get rid of the
			problem with a fake electronic light show.

						MAYOR
				(to Venkman)
			You using nerve gas?

						VENKMAN
			The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.

						PECK
			Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen
			from the Army ...

						STANTZ
			Bullshit!!!

						PECK
			... improperly stored and touched off with
			those high-voltage laser beams they use in
			their light show.  They caused an explosion.

The Mayor looks for help from the assembled leaders,

						FIRE COMMISSIONER
			All I know is, that wasn&#39;t a light show we
			saw this morning.  I&#39;ve seen every form of
			combustion known to man, but this beats me.

						POLICE COMMISSIONER
			And nobody&#39;s using nerve gas on all the
			people that have seen those ... things ...
			all over the city.  The walls were bleeding
			at the 53rd Precinct.  How do you explain
			that?

He looks to the Archbishop.  Everybody focuses on the ornately attired
Prelate.

						ARCHBISHOP
			Officially, the Church will not take a
			position on the religious implications of
			these ... phenomena.  However, since they
			started, people have been lining up at every
			church in the city to confess and take
			communion.  We&#39;ve had to put on extra
			priests.  Personally, I think it&#39;s a sign
			from God but don&#39;t quote me on that.

						MAYOR
				(shaking his head)
			I can&#39;t call a press conference and tell
			everyone to start praying.

WINSTON

He steps forward.

						WINSTON
			I&#39;m Winston Zeddemore, Your Honor.  I&#39;ve
			only been with the company for a couple of
			weeks, but I gotta tell you -- these things
			are real.  Since I joined these men I have
			seen shit that would turn you white.

THE MAYOR

He rubs his eyes wearily.

						MAYOR
				(to Venkman)
			So what do I do now?

VENKMAN

He seizes the moment.

						VENKMAN
			Mr. Mayor, it&#39;s a pretty simple choice.
			You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...

						PECK
				(snaps)
			That&#39;s &quot;Peck!&quot;

						VENKMAN
				(ignores him)
			... or you can accept the fact that this
			city is heading for a disaster of really
			Biblical proportions.

						MAYOR
			What do you mean &quot;Biblical?&quot;

						VENKMAN
			Old Testament, Mr. Mayor.  &quot;Wrath of
			God&quot;-type stuff.  The seas could boil, fire
			and brimstone falling from the sky ...

						STANTZ
				(chimes in)
			... forty years of darkness, earthquakes,
			mass hysteria, human sacrifice ...

						MAYOR
			Enough!  I get the point.
				(really torn)
			But what if you&#39;re wrong?

						VENKMAN
			If I&#39;m wrong then nothing happens and you
			toss us in the can.  But if I&#39;m right, and
			if we can stop this thing ... well, let&#39;s
			just say that you could save the lives of a
			lot of registered voters.

The Mayor starts nodding affirmatively, clearly convinced by Venkman&#39;s
rational assessment.

						PECK
				(furious)
			I don&#39;t believe you&#39;re seriously considering
			listening to these men!

The Mayor takes a long look at Peck.

						MAYOR
			Get him out of here.
				(Peck looks stricken)
			We&#39;ve got work to do.  What do you need
			from me?

EXT. DANA&#39;S APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME TIME

Louis arrives in front of the building and looks up, Strange lights are
beginning to flash from the windows,  He enters the building and a moment
later a huge tremor shakes the structure.

INT. DANA&#39;S FLOOR

The elevator doors open and Louis gets out. A crowd of tenants rushes onto
the elevator clutching their most prized possessions. He gets through the
panicked tenants and walks down the hall.

MRS. BLUM, a neighbor, comes out of her apartment carrying an armload of
small appliances.

						MRS. BLUM
			Louis!  What are you doing standing there
			... get out of the building ... don&#39;t you
			know it&#39;s an earthquake or something?

						LOUIS
			The Traveller is coming.

						MRS. BLUM
			Don&#39;t be crazy.  Nobody is going to come and
			visit you with all this commotion going on.

She rushes off leaving Louis alone in the hall.  He goes to Dana&#39;s door
and mechanically knocks three times.  His knocking echoes thunderously
throughout the building.

THE DOOR

It opens and Louis sees Dana standing there.  A tremendous thunderclap
rattles the building.

						LOUIS
				(his eyes light up)
			Are you the Gatekeeper?

						DANA
				(nods)
			I am Zuul.

Hearing that, Louis grabs Dana with a passion that&#39;s been building in his
unconscious for 8000 years.  He kisses her with savage lust and pulls her
to the floor out of frame as an explosive force blows through the
apartment.

INT. CITY HALL CORRIDOR

Venkman, Stantz and the Mayor walk briskly toward the vehicle dock at the
back of the building.  Aides scurry along behind  them, awaiting
instructions.

						MAYOR
			I don&#39;t understand it,  Why here?   Why now?

						VENKMAN
			What goes around, comes around, Mr. Mayor.
			The big Lazy Susan of Karma just keeps
			turning and sometimes we get the short end
			of the stick.

						STANTZ
			This may be Nature&#39;s way of telling us to
			slow down.  You have to admit it&#39;s kind of
			humbling, isn&#39;t it?

						MAYOR
				(shouts after them)
			We&#39;re humble already!  Hasn&#39;t this city
			suffered enough?

They come out onto the loading dock.

EXT. LOADING DOCK

The Ectomobile is parked there.  Winston and Spengler are charging all the
packs off the building current.  There&#39;s a lot of police activity around
them as orders are dispatched.

A POLICE CAPTAIN reports to Venkman.

						CAPTAIN
			We&#39;ve cleared the whole building and
			cordonned off the street.  I&#39;m massing our
			own special tactics squad and the National
			Guard is on standby.

						AIDE
			I better alert the Red Cross, too.

SPENGLER

He looks up and sees Janine standing on the dock. She crosses to him.

						JANINE
				(a little teary)
			I want you to have this.
				(she hands him a coin)

						SPENGLER
			What is it?

						JANINE
			It&#39;s a souvenir from the 1964 World&#39;s Fair
			at Flushing Meadow.  It&#39;s my lucky coin.

						SPENGLER
			I don&#39;t believe in luck.

						JANINE
			Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.

						SPENGLER
			Thank you.

They hug.

THE ECTOMOBILE

Stantz, Venkman and Winston get in. Spengler rushes over and joins them.

INT. ECTOMOBILE

Venkman turns around and looks at his friends.

						VENKMAN
			Okay.  Just remember, whatever happens out
			there, we are total professionals.  Not
			only are we the best Ghostbusters around,
			we&#39;re the only Ghostbusters around.  It&#39;s
			up to us.

They all shake hands.  Then Venkman sticks his hand out the window and
signals like a cavalry officer.

						VENKMAN (CONT&#39;D)
				(shouts)
			Move &#39;em out!

EXT. REAR OF CITY HALL

A pair of police motorcycles comes roaring up the driveway followed by the
Ectomobile and two police cruisers.  The motorcade turns up the street and
heads uptown at high speed. They pass a column of National Guard trucks.

EXT. DANA&#39;S APARTMENT BUILDING

The street has been blocked off with police barricades but a huge crowd
has gathered nonetheless to watch the strange lights and flashes emanating
from the upper floors of the building.

THE CROWD

The news media are out in front filming and taping everything.  A
contingent of Doomsday freaks is gathered with signs proclaiming &quot;REPENT
FOR THE END IS AT HAND!&quot;  A few Catholic priests are kneeling, performing
rites of exorcism.

THE CROWD

A gang of punks is hanging around hoping for a disaster.  A handful of
Hassidic Jews behind them are wailing in earnest.  The police work to
restrain the crowd.

THE STREET

The screaming of sirens turns the attention of the crowd as the motorcade
arrives.  As the Ectomobile rounds the corner a huge cheer goes up from
the crowd.

THE CROWD

The punks cheer. The Hassidic Jews wave their black hats and start dancing
for joy.

THE ECTOMOBILE

It pulls up in front of the building. The doors fly open and the
Ghostbusters all jump out at once.  The crowd roars.

THE PRIESTS

They leap to their feet and give each other &quot;high fives.&quot;

VENKMAN

He raises both fists like a victorious boxer.

						VENKMAN
				(shouts to the crowd)
			Ghostbusters!

The crowd thunders its approval.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They quickly finish suiting up at the rear of the Ectomobile.

						VENKMAN
				(keyed up)
			Are we all together on this now?

						WINSTON
				(in earnest)
			I think we should get on a plane right now
			and go to Australia or Indonesia until this
			blows over.

						VENKMAN
			I&#39;m going to make a note of your suggestion
			and possibly bring it up later if this thing
			really gets out of hand.  Now let&#39;s move.

They start heading for the lobby entrance to the building,

						VOICE IN CROWD (MAN)
			Get &#39;em!

						VOICE IN CROWD (GIRL)
			All right, Ghostbusters!

The crowd applauds as the Ghostbusters approach the entrance.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They stop in front of the building and look up at the roof.

THEIR POV

A blinding flash of light shoots from the rooftop temple.

THE BUILDING ENTRANCE

The whole building seems to groan as if under enormous pressure. Then
suddenly the concrete facade cracks open and the pavement in front of the
building collapses dropping the Ghostbusters and a police car into the
enormous sinkhole.  The crowd gasps.

THE SINKHOLE

There is a tense moment of silence, then the Ghostbusters pop up and climb
out of the pit.

						VENKMAN
			I&#39;ve heard of underground parking but this
			is ridiculous.

They flash the &quot;okay&quot; sign to the crowd and enter the building.

EXT. THE ROOFTOP -- SAME TIME

Dana and Louis emerge from the stairwell, approach the Temple and mount
the pedestals once occupied by the Terror Dogs.

THE TEMPLE

The walls begin to vibrate in response.

EXT. THE STREET BELOW

Blinding beams of light flash from all the windows.

INT. STAIRWELL

The Ghostbusters trudge up thirty-five flights of stairs.

INT. THIRTY-FIFTH FLOOR HALLWAY

The stairwell door opens and the Ghostbusters stagger into the hallway,
completely exhausted.

						VENKMAN
				(gasping and spitting)
			I&#39;m glad we took the stairs.

INT. DANA&#39;S DOOR

The Ghostbusters arrive. The door frame is charred and blackened by soot.
Venkman rings the doorbell.  DING-DONG.

						VENKMAN
			Dana?

						WINSTON
			Maybe we should go downstairs and call first?

Venkman knocks on the door and the door simply falls off its hinges and
crashes to the floor.  The Ghostbusters gape at the damage to the
apartment.

INT. DANA&#39;S APARTMENT

The exterior building wall is completely gone providing an unobstructed
view of the Hudson and New Jersey.  All the furniture is overturned and
the other walls are cracked.  A powerful wind blows through the apartment
fluttering the shredded curtains.

						WINSTON
				(ready to leave)
			Well, she&#39;s not here.  Let&#39;s go.

						VENKMAN
			No!  The kitchen!

INT. THE KITCHEN

The team enters and sees that the refrigerator has been blown away
revealing a hole in the wall and the entrance to a stone staircase behind
it.

VENKMAN

He looks at the forbidding portal and turns to Stantz.

						VENKMAN
				(slaps his shoulder)
			Go!

Stantz realizes that Venkman expects him to go first. He leads the charge
up the stairs.

EXT. THE ROOF

Dana and Louis stare at the Temple, then begin a miraculous and horrible
transformation into the hideous forms of the Terror Dogs.

THE TEMPLE

The solid stone walls rumble ominously and start to separate.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They come running out onto the roof and gape at the scene.

THE TEMPLE

The walls open completely revealing the secret architecture of the Temple:
A stone staircase leading to a set of monumental doors, and beyond them a
massive pyramid that appears to be suspended in mid-air with no visible
means of support.

LOUIS AND DANA

They complete their transformation into the Terror Dogs, which now turn
and snarl menacingly at the Ghostbusters.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They can&#39;t believe their eyes.

						VENKMAN
				(aghast)
			Shit!  I&#39;ve been out with some real dogs,
			but this is ridiculous!

The heavy rumbling of moving stone draws their attention back to the
temple.

THE TEMPLE

The Terror Dogs have now taken ritual positions on the staircase. The
heavy stone gates begin to open and a bright white light starts to emerge.
As the light descends the stairs a human form slowly materializes.

THE FORM

It is a thin, hollow-cheeked, distinguished looking man in his early
sixties. His eyes are burning red pin-holes, He looks around at the
spectacular rooftop view, then acknowledges the two Terror Dogs and starts
stroking them like house pets.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They stare at the apparition,

						SPENGLER
				(recognizes him)
			It&#39;s Shandor - the architect!

						WINSTON
			I thought he died!

						VENKMAN
			It doesn&#39;t seem to have slowed him down any.

						STANTZ
			I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Shandor.

He gets to his feet and speaks sharply to Gozer.

						STANTZ (CONT&#39;D)
			Gozer the Gozerian?

GOZER

He looks up and seems to notice the Ghostbusters for the first time.

STANTZ

He &#39;busts&#39; Gozer.

						STANTZ
				(forceful)
			As a duly-constituted representative of the
			City of New York, and on behalf of the
			County and State of New York, the United
			States of America, the Planet Earth and all
			its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease
			and desist any and all supernatural activity
			and return at once to your place of origin
			or next parallel dimension.

						VENKMAN
				(to Stantz)
			Well, that ought to do it.

GOZER

He stands up to his full height and regards Stantz curiously.

						GOZER
			Are you a god?

						STANTZ
				(compulsively honest)
			No.

						GOZER
			Then die!

He raises his arms and blows away the Ghostbusters with searing bolts of
energy.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

Momentarily stunned, they tumble all the way down the stairs and almost
fall off the edge of the roof.

						WINSTON
				(to Stantz)
			You should&#39;ve said &quot;yes!&quot;  He might have
			been willing to negotiate.

Venkman gets to his feet first, really mad now.

						VENKMAN
				(setting his wands)
			Okay.  That&#39;s it!  I&#39;m gonna turn this guy
			into toast.

The Ghostbusters leap into action.  One by one they activate their Proton
packs and take up positions for an entrapment.

GOZER

He braces for the onslaught.

VENKMAN

He shoots a particle stream at Gozer.

GOZER

He leaps out of the way with superhuman agility and executes a perfect
double-flip with a half-twisting round-off at the end.

VENKMAN

He can&#39;t believe his eyes.

						VENKMAN
			Agile bastard, isn&#39;t he?

						STANTZ
			Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!

The others adjust their units and they all blaze away at Gozer.

GOZER

He stands there calmly and absorbs the force of the streams.  There is a
brilliant pink flash and Gozer disappears.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They stare for a long moment, finding it hard to believe that they won.
Then Winston lets out a triumphant whoop.

SPENGLER

He scans the temple with his PKE meter, not at all convinced the danger
has passed.

STANTZ

He bounds up the stairs.

						STANTZ
				(jubilant)
			We neutronized him!  The guy&#39;s a molecular
			nonentity.

VENKMAN AND SPENGLER

He wants to believe it but sees the doubt on Spengler&#39;s face.

						SPENGLER
				(reading the meter)
			Not necessarily.

There is a deep seismic rumble and the entire building begins to vibrate.
The Ghostbusters look around nervously as the entire building starts to
sway.

EXT. THE EAVES

Cement carvings and moldings around the edge of the roof crack and break
off.

EXT. THE STREET

The crowd screams and runs as cement debris rains down the side of the
building and crashes on the sidewalk.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They look up at the sky waiting for the big blow.  An incredibly loud
thunderclap rocks the rooftop.

THE SKY

A bolt of lightning crackles from the swirling dark cloud and strikes the
rooftop.

The Ghostbusters stand there facing their new God like Moses on Mount
Sinai.  And then Gozer speaks to them in a voice that can be heard
throughout Metropolitan New York and parts of New Jersey.

						GOZER
			SUBCREATURES!  GOZER THE GOZERIAN, GOZER
			THE DESTRUCTOR, VOLGUUS ZILDROHAR, THE
			TRAVELLER HAS COME.  CHOOSE AND PERISH.

						VENKMAN
				(shouting to be heard)
			Is he talking to us?

						WINSTON
			What&#39;s he talking about?  Choose what?

						STANTZ
				(to the heavens)
			What do you mean &quot;choose?&quot;  We don&#39;t
			understand.

						GOZER
			CHOOSE!!

						SPENGLER
			I think he&#39;s saying that since we&#39;re about
			to be sacrificed anyway, we get to choose
			the form we want him to take.

						STANTZ
			You mean if I stand here and concentrate on
			the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will
			appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?

						SPENGLER
			That appears to be the case.

						VENKMAN
				(quickly)
			Don&#39;t think of anything yet.  Clear your
			minds.  We only get one crack at this.

						GOZER
			The choice is made.  The Traveller has come.

						VENKMAN
				(in a panic)
			We didn&#39;t choose anything!
				(to the others)
			I didn&#39;t think of an image, did you?

						SPENGLER
			No.

They look at Winston.

						WINSTON
			My mind&#39;s a total void!

They all look at Stantz.

						STANTZ
				(guilty)
			I couldn&#39;t help it!  It just popped in
			there!

						VENKMAN
				(desperately)
			What?  What popped in there?

						STANTZ
				(pointing)
			Look!

They all turn and look to the south.

GHOSTBUSTERS POV

Looking south past Columbus Circle, they see part of something big and
white moving between the buildings accompanied by thunderous footsteps of
almost seismic proportions.

VENKMAN

He doesn&#39;t know what it is yet, but he knows it&#39;s coming.

						VENKMAN
				(desperately)
			What is it?  Ray, what did you think of?

BROADWAY AND 55TH

The massive white shape passes behind some buildings, offering a glimpse
of what appears to be a fat, white arm.

STANTZ

He&#39;s about to go into shock.

						STANTZ
				(babbling)
			It can&#39;t be!  It can&#39;t be!

COLUMBUS CIRCLE

The thundering footsteps continue to plod as the thing starts to emerge
from behind the buildings.  Now we can see part of a blue garment covering
its enormous chest.

STANTZ

He recognizes the monster.

						STANTZ
			It&#39;s ... It&#39;s ... It&#39;s the STAY-PUFT
			MARSHMALLOW MAN.

Winston, Venkman and Spengler gape.

THEIR POV

They look across the roof tops and see a large, square, white, bobbing,
laughing head atop a massive body of similar puffed white squares.  The
being is dressed in a tiny sailor&#39;s hat, red bosun&#39;s whistle and lanyard
and a little blue vest with a button undone in the middle revealing a
little white belly. It is the cute, quintessential American brand symbol,
looming as large as Godzilla.

						STANTZ (V.O.)
				(desperately apologizing)
			I tried to think of the most harmless thing
			... something that could never destroy us
			... something I loved from my childhood.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They watch the Marshmallow Man plodding toward them.

						VENKMAN
			AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?

						STANTZ
			The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on
			all the packages we used to buy when I was
			a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft
			marshmallows at Camp Waconda!

						VENKMAN
			Great!  The marshmallows are about to get
			their revenge.

THE STAY-PUFT MAN

He plods relentlessly uptown toward the Ghostbusters&#39; rooftop vantage
point.  The ground rumbles as his big, soft feet come down on the
pavement.

THE STREET

People are fleeing in panic as the marshmallow feet pad along kicking over
lampposts and mail boxes.

A CAR

The driver jumps out just before an enormous white marshmallow foot comes
down and flattens his automobile.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They stand there helplessly watching the laughing bobbing head of the
Stay-Puft Man as he comes toward them.

						VENKMAN
			What now?

						SPENGLER
				(adjusting his thrower)
			Full-stream with strogon pulse.

Venkman looks at Stantz.  Stantz shrugs.

						VENKMAN
				(decides)
			I guess that&#39;s all we&#39;ve got.

They step to the edge of the roof, moving like warriors now ready to face
the consequences.

EXT. THE STREET

Peck comes running up to the front of the apartment building.  People are
fleeing the oncoming monster.  Peck grabs a COP who is just about to flee
himself.

						PECK
				(in a rage)
			Are the Ghostbusters up there?

						COP
				(desperate to get away)
			Yeah!

						PECK
			I want you to go up on the roof and arrest
			them.  This time they&#39;ve gone too far.

The Cop looks at Peck like he&#39;s insane, then sees the Stay-Puft Man
looming up at the end of the block.

						COP
				(knocking Peck&#39;s hands
				away)
			You arrest them, numb nuts!  I&#39;m getting out
			of here.

He runs off.  Peck turns to face the monster.

THE STAY PUFT MAN

The ground shakes with every step as he reaches the building. Then, using
the church next door as a stepping stone, he begins climbing the wall.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They look over the edge of the roof as the Marshmallow Man climbs higher
and higher.

						VENKMAN
				(shouts)
			Hit him!

They each fire point blank at the Stay-Puft Man.

THE STAY-PUFT MAN

He bellows with pain and rage as the beams strike him right in the chest
and set his skin on fire.  He begins to burn with a blue flame that
spreads quickly across his torso and down his arms.  The Stay-Puft Man
bellows even louder, flailing its huge arms in response to the searing
flames that are starting to engulf him.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They stare at the horrible conflagration.

						WINSTON
			Good.  Now we made him mad.

THE STAY-PUFT MAN

Carbonous, flaming hunks of melting marshmallow are flying from his arms
as he waves them in wild rage.

THE STREET

Peck stands there paralyzed with fear.  A mass of flaming marshmallow
falls and flattens a news stand nearby.  Then a huge glob of sticky
toasted marshmallow comes zipping down from above and lands right on him,
burying him up to his neck in melted sucrose.

THE STAY-PUFT MAN

The flaming monster keeps coming intent on their destruction.  Most of his
chest has melted away revealing horrid musculature and a skeletal rib
cage.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They square off and face him for the last time, their weapons poised.

						VENKMAN
				(calmly)
			We&#39;re going to be killed by a hundred-foot
			marshmallow.

THE STAY-PUFT MAN

He is almost on them now, fully engulfed in flames, reaching for them,
ready to swat them with his burning fist.

						VENKMAN
				(to the others)
			On the count of three!  One ... Two ...

						SPENGLER
				(he has the best idea of
				his life)
			No!  Them!  Shoot them!
				(he points at the Terror
				Dogs)
			Cross the beams.

THE TERROR DOGS

They stand beside the portal literally petrified.

VENKMAN

He hesitates.

						VENKMAN
				(protesting)
			No!  You said crossing the beams would be
			BAD.  It&#39;ll kill her!  And us!

						SPENGLER
			Life is just a state of mind.

						VENKMAN
			But it&#39;s my favorite state.

						STANTZ
			Either way we&#39;re history.

THE STAY-PUFT MAN

His burning fist is starting to descend on the Ghostbusters.

VENKMAN

He chooses the only way out.

						VENKMAN
				(shouts)
			Now!!

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They turn and fire at the two petrified Terror Dogs and blow them to
oblivion. The entire front of the temple is obliterated along with the
door.

THE STAY-PUFT MAN

With the destruction of his earthly portal, the flaming monster is
suddenly engulfed in a cyclonic wind that begins to swirl around him like
a fire-storm.  The flames are whipped higher and higher as the tornado
begins to pick up rotational speed. Then the Marshmallow Man seems to
explode from deep inside creating a flaming air burst high above the
rooftops.

THE ROOFTOP

The Ghostbusters are blasted off their feet.

THE SKY

The fireball reaches its maximum explosive force, then a sudden jet of air
pressure occurs like a titanic vacuum cleaner in the sky and sucks the
flaming mass of gasses and ash up through our atmosphere and right out of
our dimension.  The dark clouds disappear with it, leaving a beautiful
clear blue sky over the whole area.

THE TEMPLE

It now looks like an ancient ruin.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They are lying at the foot of the stairs. Everything is still.  One by one
they get slowly to their feet and look around to see that the crisis has
passed.

						STANTZ
			Everybody okay?

Venkman looks up at the portal.

THE TERROR DOGS

They are still on the pedestals but charred almost beyond recognition.
Venkman mounts the stairs and gazes sadly at the remains.

THE PEDESTAL

Venkman stands there mourning, then a slight movement under the blackened
skin of the Terror Dog catches his eye.  The movement gets stronger, then
suddenly a human hand pokes through the carbonous coating.

VENKMAN

Hope surges in him and he starts frantically tearing away the black
coating, finally revealing Dana alive and well under the burnt skin of the
Terror Dog.

STANTZ AND SPENGLER

They peel the charred coating off Louis and help him to his feet.

LOUIS

He looks around wondering how he ended up on the roof of a wrecked
high-rise. He looks at his scorched and ripped suit crusted with the
still-smoking gobs of melted marshmallow.

						LOUIS
				(amazed)
			Jeez!  Somebody must have spiked the egg
			salad.

VENKMAN

He helps Dana to her feet.

						VENKMAN
			Are you all right?

She looks around at the incredible scene.

						DANA
				(totally confused)
			Oh, sure.  I&#39;m getting used to this.

						LOUIS
				(seeing Dana for the first
				time)
			I&#39;m innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never
			touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.

						DANA
				(getting annoyed)
			All right, what happened to me?

						VENKMAN
			Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in
			your kitchen.

						DANA
			Really!  Is it gone?

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, along with most of your furniture and
			a lot of your personal possessions.  This
			one took some work.

						DANA
				(noting the wrecked temple)
			Thank you.  Next time I want to break a
			lease I&#39;ll know who to call.

She hugs him.

						VENKMAN
			This is going to cost you, you know.  Our
			fees are ridiculously high.

						DANA
			Talk to my accountant.
				(she indicates Louis)

						LOUIS
			Oh, great!  I bet we could write off all the
			damage as an Act of God.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They look at each other and nod.

						STANTZ
			I&#39;ll go along with that.

EXT. STREET - NEAR THE APARTMENT - NIGHT THE TWO BUMS

They hear the cheering down the street as they cautiously inspect a
massive mound of cooling sucrose.

						FIRST BUM
			Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow
			to me.

						SECOND BUM
				(sniffing it)
			Yeah, it&#39;s some kind of mallow-type
			substance - that&#39;s for sure.

						FIRST BUM
			You have to wonder why anybody would dump a
			marshmallow that size right in the middle of
			the street.

						SECOND BUM
			I wonder if there might not be a very large
			cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.

						FIRST BUM
			That would definitely explain it.

EXT. THE STREET   NIGHT

A happy throng of jubilant citizens is gathered outside the lobby entrance
to the apartment building.

THE ENTRANCE

The battered but victorious Ghostbusters emerge from the lobby.  Venkman
and Dana are holding hands.  The crowd roars with unrestrained joy and
gratitude,  Janine runs over and hugs Spengler enthusiastically.  The
Ghostbusters wave and head for the Ectomobile parked at the curb.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They get into the Ectomobile and drive off with lights flashing and sirens
screaming as the crowd cheers wildly.

          PADUA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
          
          Welcome to Padua High School,, your typical urban-suburban 
          high school in Portland, Oregon.  Smarties, Skids, Preppies, 
          Granolas. Loners, Lovers, the In and the Out Crowd rub sleep 
          out of their eyes and head for the main building.
          
          PADUA HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          KAT STRATFORD, eighteen, pretty -- but trying hard not to be 
          -- in a baggy granny dress and glasses, balances a cup of 
          coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of her battered, 
          baby blue &#39;75 Dodge Dart.
          
          A stray SKATEBOARD clips her, causing her to stumble and 
          spill her coffee, as well as the contents of her backpack.
          
          The young RIDER dashes over to help, trembling when he sees 
          who his board has hit.
          
                                 RIDER
                    Hey -- sorry.
          
          Cowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered 
          belongings.
          
                                 KAT
                    Leave it 
          
          He persists.
          
                                 KAT (continuing)
                    I said, leave it!
          
          She grabs his skateboard and uses it to SHOVE him against a 
          car, skateboard tip to his throat.  He whimpers pitifully 
          and she lets him go.  A path clears for her as she marches 
          through a pack of fearful students and SLAMS open the door, 
          entering school.
          
          INT. GIRLS&#39; ROOM - DAY
          
          BIANCA STRATFORD, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the 
          mirror, applying lipstick.  Her less extraordinary, but 
          still cute friend, CHASTITY stands next to her.  
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Did you change your hair?
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    No.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You might wanna think about it
          
          Leave the girls&#39; room and enter the hallway.
          
          HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS
          
          Bianca is immediately greeted by an admiring crowd, both 
          boys
          and girls alike.
          
                                 BOY
                           (adoring)
                    Hey, Bianca.
          
                                 GIRL
                    Awesome shoes.
          
          The greetings continue as Chastity remains wordless and 
          unaddressed by her side.  Bianca smiles proudly, 
          acknowledging her fans.
          
          GUIDANCE COUNSELOR&#39;S OFFICE - DAY
          
          CAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going senior with an open, 
          farm-boy face, sits facing Miss Perky, an impossibly cheery 
          guidance counselor.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t find Padua any 
                    different than your old school.  Same 
                    little asswipe mother-fuckers 
                    everywhere.
          
          Her plastic smile never leaves her face.  Cameron fidgets in 
          his chair uncomfortably.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                           (continuing)
                    Any questions?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I don&#39;t think so, ma&#39;am
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Then go forth.  Scoot   I&#39;ve got 
                    deviants to see.
          
          Cameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with PATRICK 
          VERONA, a sullen-looking bad ass senior who waits outside Ms 
          Perky&#39;s door.  His slouch and smirk let us know how cool he 
          is.
          
          Miss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                           (continuing)
                    Patrick Verona.  I see we&#39;re making our 
                    visits a weekly ritual.
          
          She gives him a withering glance. He answers with a charming 
          smile.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I missed you.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    It says here you exposed yourself to a 
                    group of freshmen girls.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It was a bratwurst.  I was eating 
                    lunch.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    With the teeth of your zipper?
          
          She motions for Patrick to enter her office and Cameron 
          shuffles out the door, bumping into MICHAEL ECKMAN, a lanky, 
          brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game 
          show host.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You the new guy?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So they tell me...
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    C&#39;mon.  I&#39;m supposed to give you the 
                    tour.
          
          They head out of the office
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    So -- which Dakota you from?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    North, actually.  How&#39;d you   ?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I was kidding. People actually live 
                    there?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Yeah.  A couple.  We&#39;re outnumbered by 
                    the cows, though.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    How many people were in your old 
                    school?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Thirty-two.

          Prom posters adorn the wall. Michael steers Cameron through 
          the crowd as he points to various cliques.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    We&#39;ve got your basic beautiful people. 
                    Unless they talk to you first, don&#39;t 
                    bother.
          
          The beautiful people pass, in full jock/cheerleader

          Several Stetson-wearing, big belt buckle. Wrangler guys

                    Yeah, but these guys have never seen a 
                    horse.  They just jack off to Clint 
                    Eastwood.
          
          They pass an espresso cart with a group of teens huddled 
          around it.

          Several white boys in dreadlocks and Jamaican knit berets 
          lounge on the grass.  A cloud of pot smoke hovers above them

          Loud music and loud students.  Michael sits with a group of

          He points proudly to the ALLIGATOR on his shirt.
          
          Cameron stops listening as BIANCA walks by, and we go SLO

          without a look.

                    I could start with your haircut, but it 
                    doesn&#39;t matter.  She&#39;s not allowed to 
                    date until her older sister does.  And 
                    that&#39;s an impossibility.

          A room full of bored seniors doodle and scare off into space 
          MS. BLAISE, the one-step-away-from-medication English 
          Teacher, tries to remember what she&#39;s talking about.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    Well, then.  Oh, yes.  I guess that 
                    does it for our analysis of The Old Man 
                    and the Sea.  Any other comments?
                           (with dread)
                    Kat?
          
          Kat, the girl we saw as we entered the school, slowly cakes 
          off her glasses and speaks up.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why didn&#39;t we just read the Hardy Boys?
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    I&#39;m sorry?
          
                                 KAT
                    This book is about a guy and his 
                    fishing habit.  Not exactly a crucial 
                    topic.
          
          The other students roll their eyes.
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    Frankly, I&#39;m baffled as to why we still 
                    revere Hemingway.  He was an abusive, 
                    alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of 
                    cats.
          
          JOEY DORSEY, a well-muscled jock with great cheekbones, 
          makes fun of her from his row.
          
                                 JOEY
                    As opposed to a bitter self-righteous 
                    hag who has no friends?
          
          A few giggles.  Kat ignores him.  A practiced gesture
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    That&#39;s enough, Mr. Dorsey.
          
          Really gets fired up now
          
                                 KAT
                    I guess the school board thinks because 
                    Hemingway&#39;s male and an asshole, he&#39;s 
                    worthy of our time
          
          She looks up at Ms. Blaise, who is now fighting with her 
          pill box.

                    Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You&#39;ve 
                    been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
          
                                 KAT
                    Expressing my opinion is not a 
                    terrorist action.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Well, yes, compared to your other 
                    choices of expression this year, today&#39;s 
                    events are quite mild.  By the way, 
                    Bobby Rictor&#39;s gonad retrieval operation 
                    went quite well, in case you&#39;re 
                    interested.
          
                                 KAT
                    I still maintain that he kicked himself 
                    in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    The point is Kat -- people perceive you 
                    as somewhat ...
          
          Kat smiles at her, daring her to say it.
          
                                 KAT
                    Tempestuous?
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    No ... I believe &quot;heinous bitch&quot; is the 
                    term used most often.
          
          She grimaces, as if she&#39;s referring to a medical condition.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                           (continuing)
                    You might want to work on that
          
          Kat rises from her chair with a plastic smile matching the 
          counselor&#39;s.
          
                                 KAT

          Bianca ignores the droning teacher as she writes a note in 
          big flowing handwriting.
          
                                 TEACHER (0.S.)
                    I realize the language of Mr. 
                    Shakespeare makes him a bit daunting, 
                    but I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all doing your best.
          
          Bianca folds the note and passes it behind her with a flip 
          of her hair to CHASTITY.  Chastity opens the note and reads:

          GOD!&quot;
          
          Chastity frowns to herself.

                    Ms. Stratford, do you care to comment 
                    on what you&#39;ve read so far?
          
          Bianca looks up and smiles the smile of Daddy&#39;s little girl.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Not really.
          
          The teacher shakes her head, but lets it go.
          
          MANDELLA. a waif-like senior girl who sits off to the side 
          trying to slit her wrist with the plastic spiral on her 
          notebook, looks up and raises her hand.

                                 KAT
                    The fact that you&#39;re cutting gym so you

                    his name, is a little without in itself 
                    if you ask me.
          
          Kat&#39;s attention is caught by Patrick as he walks by with his 
          friends, lighting up a cigarette.  Mandella notices her 
          staring.

                    That&#39;s Pat Verona? The one who was gone

                    I&#39;m sure he&#39;s completely incapable of 
                    doing anything that interesting.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    He always look so
          
                                 KAT
                    Block E?
          
          Kat turns back to face Mandella and forces her yogurt into 
          Mandella&#39;s hand.
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a 
                    very slow way to die.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Just a little.
          
          She eats.  Kat sees her wrist
          
                                 KAT
                    What&#39;s this?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    An attempted slit.
          
          Kat stares at her, expressionless.
          
                                 KAT
                    I realize that the men of this fine 
                    institution are severely lacking, but 
                    killing yourself so you can be with 
                    William Shakespeare is beyond the scope 
                    of normal teenage obsessions.  You&#39;re 
                    venturing far past daytime talk show 
                    fodder and entering the world of those 
                    who need very expensive therapy.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    But imagine the things he&#39;d say during 
                    sex.
          
          Thinks a minute
          
                                 KAT
                    Okay, say you do it.  You kill 
                    yourself, you end up in wherever you end 
                    up and he&#39;s there.  Do you really think 
                    he&#39;s gonna wanna dace a ninety pound 
                    compulsive who failed volleyball?
          
          Mandella&#39;s attention is struck by Bianca
          
          ACROSS THE COURTYARD
          
          As she and Chastity parade by Joey and his COHORTS   One of 
          the cohorts elbows Joey.
          
                                 COHORT
                    Virgin alert.
          
          Joey looks up and smiles at Bianca.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Lookin&#39; good, ladies.
          
          Bianca smiles her coyest of smiles.
          
          BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA Still watching.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Tragic.
          
          Doesn&#39;t respond
          
          ANOTHER ANGLE
          
          Michael and Cameron observe Joey&#39;s leers at Bianca from 
          their bench in another corner. Cowboys eating cue of a can 
          of beans linger on the grass behind them.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Why do girls like that always like guys 
                    like that?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Because they&#39;re bred to.  Their mothers 
                    liked guys like that, and their 
                    grandmothers before them. Their gene 
                    pool is rarely diluted.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    He always have that shit-eating grin?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish 
                    I could say he&#39;s a moron, but he&#39;s 
                    number twelve in the class.  And a 
                    model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he&#39;s 
                    rumored to have a big tube sock ad 
                    coming out.
          
          The BELL rings, and the cowboys stand and spit into their 
          empty bean cans.   Cameron and Michael rise as Cameron tries 
          to catch a glimpse of Bianca as she walks back inside.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    You know French?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Sure do ... my Mom&#39;s from Canada
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You mean I&#39;d get a chance to talk to 
                    her?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You could consecrate with her, my 
                    friend.
          
          Cameron watches as Bianca flounces back into the building.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          Kat and Mandella walk toward Kat&#39;s car.  Joey pulls up 
          beside her in his Viper.
          
                                 JOEY
                           (re her dress)
                    The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven&#39;t 
                    you been reading your Sassy?
          
                                 KAT
                    Yeah, and I noticed the only part of 
                    you featured in your big Kmart spread 
                    was your elbow.  Tough break.
          
                                 JOEY
                           (practically 
                           spitting)
                    They&#39;re running the rest of me next 
                    month.
          
          He zooms away as Kat yanks open the door of her Dart.  
          Mandella ties a silk scarf around her head, as if they&#39;re in 
          a convertible.
          
                                 KAT
                    The people at this school are so 
                    incredibly foul.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    You could always go with me.  I&#39;m sure 
                    William has some friends.
          
          They watch Joey&#39;s car as he slows next to Bianca and 
          Chastity as they walk toward the school bus.
          
          ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY
          
                                 JOEY
                    Need a ride, ladies?
          
          Bianca and Chastity can&#39;t get in Joey&#39;s car fast enough.  He 
          pulls away with a smile.
          
          BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA
          
          Mandella lowers her sunglasses to watch.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    That&#39;s a charming new development
          
          Kat doesn&#39;t answer, but reaches over and puts a tape in the 
          tape deck.  The sounds of JOYFUL PUNK ROCK fill the car.
          
          As they pull out, Michael crosses in front of them on his 
          moped. Kat has to SLAM the brakes to keep from hitting him
          
                                 KAT
                           (yelling)
                    Remove head from sphincter!  Then 
                    pedal!
          
          Michael begins fearfully, pedaling as Kat PEELS out, angry 
          at the delay.
          
          Cameron rushes over
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You all right?
          
          He slows to a stop
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Yeah, just a minor encounter with the 
                    shrew.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That&#39;s her?  Bianca&#39;s sister?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
          
          Michael putters off, leaving Cameron dodging Patrick&#39;s 
          grimy, grey Jeep -- a vehicle several years and many paint 
          jobs away from its former glory as a REGULATION MAIL TRUCK -
          - as he sideswipes several cars on his way out of the lot.
          
          INT.  STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY
          
          SHARON STRATFORD, attractive and focused, sits in front of 
          her computer, typing quickly.   A shelf next to her holds 
          several bodice-ripper romance novels, bearing her name. 
          
          Kat stands behind her, reading over her shoulder as she 
          types.
          
                                 KAT
                    &quot;Undulating with desire, Adrienne 
                    removes her crimson cape, revealing her 
                    creamy --&quot;
          
          WALTER STRATFORD, a blustery, mad scientist-type 
          obstetrician, enters through the front door, wearing a 
          doctor&#39;s white jacket and carrying his black bag.
          
                                 WALTER
          
          I hope dinner&#39;s ready because I only have ten minutes before 
          Mrs. Johnson squirts out a screamer.
          
          He grabs the mail and rifles through it, as he bends down to 
          kiss Sharon on the cheek.
          
                                 SHARON
                    In the microwave.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (to Kat)
                    Make anyone cry today?
          
                                 KAT
                    Sadly, no.  But it&#39;s only four-thirty.
          
          Bianca walks in.
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    Where&#39;ve you been?
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (eyeing Walter)
                    Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
          
          She kisses him on the cheek
          
                                 WALTER
                    Hello, precious.
          
          Walter kisses Bianca back as Kat heads up the stairs
          
                                 KAT
                    How touching.
          
          Walter holds up a letter to Kat
          
                                 WALTER
                    What&#39;s this?  It says Sarah Lawrence?
          
          Snatches it away from him.
          
                                 KAT
                    I guess I got in
          
          Sharon looks up from her computer.
          
                                 SHARON
                    What&#39;s a synonym for throbbing?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of 
                    the country.
          
                                 KAT
                    I know.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I thought we decided you were going to 
                    school here.  At U of 0.
          
                                 KAT
                    You decided.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Is there even a question that we want 
                    her to stay?
          
          Kat gives Bianca an evil look then smiles sweetly at
          
                                 KAT
                    Ask Bianca who drove her home
          
                                 SHARON
                    Swollen...turgid.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (to Bianca; upset)
                    Who drove you home?
          
          Bianca glares at Kat then turns to Walter
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Now don&#39;t get upset. Daddy, but there&#39;s 
                    this boy... and I think he might ask...
          
                                 WALTER
                    No! You&#39;re not dating until your sister 
                    starts dating.  End of discussion.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    What if she never starts dating?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Then neither will you.  And I&#39;ll get to 
                    sleep at night.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But it&#39;s not fair -- she&#39;s a mutant, 
                    Daddy!
          
                                 KAT
                    This from someone whose diary is 
                    devoted to favorite grooming tips?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Enough!
          
          He pulls out a small tape recorder from his black bag.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    Do you know what this is?
          
          He hits the &quot;play&#39; button and SHRIEKS OF PAIN emanate from 
          the tape recorder.
          
          BIANCA AND WALTER
                           (in unison, by 
                           rote)
                    The sound of a fifteen-year-old in 
                    labor.
          
                                 WALTER
                    This is why you&#39;re not dating until 
                    your sister does.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But she doesn&#39;t want to date.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Exactly my point
          
          His BEEPER goes off and he grabs his bag again
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich 
                    before you women start dilating?
          
                                 SHARON
                    Tumescent!
          
                                 WALTER
                           (to Sharon; as he 
                           leaves)
                    You&#39;re not helping.
          
          INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY
          
          Cameron sits with an empty chair beside him.  Bianca arrives 
          in a flurry of blonde hair.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can we make this quick?  Roxanne 
                    Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an 
                    incredibly horrendous public break- up 
                    on the quad.  Again.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Well, I thought we&#39;d start with 
                    pronunciation, if that&#39;s okay with you.
          
          BIANCA
          Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (looking down)
                    Okay... then how &#39;bout we try out some 
                    French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
          
          Bianca smiles slowly
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You&#39;re asking me out.  That&#39;s so cute.  
                    What&#39;s your name again?
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (embarrassed)
                    Forget it.
          
          Bianca seizes an opportunity.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No, no, it&#39;s my fault -- we didn&#39;t have 
                    a proper introduction ---
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Cameron.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    The thing is, Cameron -- I&#39;m at the 
                    mercy of a particularly hideous breed of 
                    loser.  My sister.  I can&#39;t date until 
                    she does.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Seems like she could get a date easy 
                    enough...
          
          She fingers a lock of her hair.  He looks on, dazzled.
          
                                 BIANCA
          
          The problem is, she&#39;s completely anti-social.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Why?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Unsolved mystery.  She used to be 
                    really popular when she started high 
                    school, then it was just like she got 
                    sick of it or something.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That&#39;s a shame.
          
          She reaches out and touches his arm
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Gosh, if only we could find Kat a 
                    boyfriend...
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Let me see what I can do.
          
          Cameron smiles, having no idea how stupid he is
          
          INT. BIOLOGY CLASS
          
          A frog is being torn asunder by several prongs and picks.  
          Michael and Cameron go for the spleen.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You&#39;re in school for one day and you 
                    ask out the most beautiful girl?  Do you 
                    have no concept of the high school 
                    social code?
          
          Cameron grins away
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I teach her French, get to know her, 
                    dazzle her with charm and she falls in 
                    love with me.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Unlikely, but even so, she still can&#39;t 
                    go out with you.  So what&#39;s the
                    point?
          
          Cameron motions with his head toward Patrick, a few lab 
          tables away.  He&#39;s wearing biker glasses instead of goggles 
          as he tries to revive his frog.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    What about him?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (confused)
                    You wanna go out with him?
          
          The others at the lab table raise their eyebrows
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (impatient)
                    No - he could wrangle with the sister.
          
          Michael smiles.  Liking the intrigue.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    What makes you think he&#39;ll do it?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    He seems like he thrives on danger
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    No kidding.  He&#39;s a criminal.  I heard 
                    he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just 
                    got out of Alcatraz...
          
                                 CAMERON
                    They always let felons sit in on Honors 
                    Biology?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I&#39;m serious, man, he&#39;s whacked.  He 
                    sold his own liver on the black market 
                    so he could buy new speakers.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Forget his reputation.  Do you think 
                    we&#39;ve got a plan or not?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Did she actually say she&#39;d go out with 
                    you?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That&#39;s what I just said
          
          Michael processes this.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You know, if you do go out with Bianca, 
                    you&#39;d be set.  You&#39;d outrank everyone.  
                    Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I thought you hated those people.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey -- I&#39;ve gotta have a few clients 
                    when I get to Wall Street.
          
          A cowboy flicks the frog&#39;s heart into one of the Coffee 
          Kid&#39;s latte.  Cameron presses on, over the melee.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So now all we gotta do is talk to him.
          
          He points to Patrick, who now makes his frog hump another 
          frog, with full-on sound effects.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I&#39;ll let you handle that.
          
          INT. WOODSHOP - DAY
          
          Boys and a few stray girls nail their pieces of wood
          
          Michael sits next to PEPE, a Coffee Kid, who holds out his 
          jacket like the men who sell watches in the subway.  Inside 
          several bags of coffee hang from hooks.
          
                                 PEPE
                    Some people like the Colombian, but it 
                    all depends on your acidity preference.  
                    Me?  I prefer East African and 
                    Indonesian.  You start the day with a 
                    Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian 
                    Sidamo in your cup, you&#39;re that much 
                    farther ahead than someone drinkin&#39; 
                    Cosia Rican or Kona -- you know what I 
                    mean?
          
          Michael nods solemnly.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Patrick sits at a table with Scurvy, making something that 
          looks like a machete out of a two-by-four.
          
          Cameron approaches, full of good-natured farm boy cheer
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Hey, there
          
          In response, Patrick brandishes a loud POWER TOOL in his 
          direction.
          
          Cameron slinks away.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    Later, then. 
          
          Michael watches, shaking his head.
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          Joey and his pals take turns drawing boobs onto a cafeteria 
          tray with a magic marker.
          
          Michael walks up and sits between them, casual as can be
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Are you lost?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Nope - just came by to chat
          
                                 JOEY
                    We don&#39;t chat.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Well, actually, I thought I&#39;d run an 
                    idea by you.  You know, just to see if 
                    you&#39;re interested.
          
                                 JOEY
                    We&#39;re not.
          
          He grabs Michael by the side of the head, and proceeds to 
          draw a penis on his cheek with the magic marker.   Michael 
          suffers the indignity and speaks undaunted.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (grimacing)
                    Hear me out.  You want Bianca don&#39;t 
                    you?
          
          Joey sits back and cackles at his drawing.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    But she can&#39;t go out with you because 
                    her sister is this insane head case and 
                    no one will go out with her. right?
          
                                 JOEY
                    Does this conversation have a purpose?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    So what you need to do is recruit a guy 
                    who&#39;ll go out with her.  Someone who&#39;s 
                    up for the job.
          
          Michael points to Patrick, who makes a disgusted face at his 
          turkey pot pie before he rises and throws it at the garbage 
          can, rather than in it.
          
                                 JOEY
          
          That guy?  I heard he ate a live duck once.  Everything but 
          the beak and the feet.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Exactly
          
          Joey turns to look at Michael.
          
                                 JOEY
          
          What&#39;s in it for you?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Oh, hey, nothin&#39; man   Purely good will 
                    on my part.
          
          He rises to leave and turns to the others.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    I have a dick on my face, don&#39;t I? 
          
          INT. BOY&#39;S ROOM - DAY
          
          Michael stands at the sink, trying to scrub Joey&#39;s artwork 
          off his face as Cameron watches.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You got him involved?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when 
                    you let the enemy think he&#39;s 
                    orchestrating the battle, you&#39;re in a 
                    position of power. We let him pretend 
                    he&#39;s calling the shots, and while he&#39;s 
                    busy setting up the plan, you have time 
                    to woo Bianca.
          
          Cameron grins and puts an arm around him
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You&#39;re one brilliant guy
          
          Michael pulls back, noticing other guys filing in.
          
                                 MICHAEL
          
          Hey - I appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy, but 
          it&#39;s not gonna do you any good to be known as New Kid Who 
          Embraces Guys In The Bathroom. 
          
          Cameron pulls back and attempts to posture himself in a 
          manly way for the others, now watching.
          
          INT. KENNY&#39;S THAI FOOD DINER - DAY
          
          Kat and Mandella pick apart their pad thai.  Mandella is 
          smoking.
          
                                 KAT
                    So he has this huge raging fit about 
                    Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to 
                    his male-dominated, puking frat boy, 
                    number one golf team school. I have no 
                    say at all.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    William would never have gone to a 
                    state school.
          
                                 KAT
                    William didn&#39;t even go to high school
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    That&#39;s never been proven
          
                                 KAT
                    Neither has his heterosexuality.
          
          Mandella replies with a look of ice.  Kat uses the moment to 
          stub out Mandella&#39;s cigarette. 
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    I appreciate your efforts toward a 
                    speedy death, but I&#39;m consuming.
                           (pointing at her 
                           food)
                    Do you mind?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Does it matter?
          
                                 KAT
                    If I was Bianca, it would be, &quot;Any 
                    school you want, precious.  Don&#39;t forget 
                    your tiara.&quot;
          
          They both look up as Patrick enters.  He walks up to the 
          counter to place his order.
          
          Mandella leans toward Kat with the glow of fresh gossip
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Janice Parker told me he was a roadie 
                    for Marilyn Manson.
          
          Patrick nods at them as he takes his food outside.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Janice Parker is an idiot
          
          INT.  MISS PERKY&#39;S OFFICE - DAY 
          
          Patrick sits before Miss Perky, eating his Thai food
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                           (looking at chart)
                    I don&#39;t understand, Patrick.  You 
                    haven&#39;t done anything asinine this week.  
                    Are you not feeling well?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Touch of the flu.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    I&#39;m at a loss, then.  What should we 
                    talk about? Your year of absence?
          
          He smiles his charming smile
          
                                 PATRICK
                    How &#39;bout your sex life?
          
          She tolerates his comment with her withering glance.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Why don&#39;t we discuss your driving need 
                    to be a hemorrhoid?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    What&#39;s to discuss?
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    You weren&#39;t abused, you aren&#39;t stupid, 
                    and as far as I can tell, you&#39;re only 
                    slightly psychotic -- so why is it that 
                    you&#39;re such a fuck-up?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Well, you know -- there&#39;s the prestige 
                    of the job title... and the benefits 
                    package is pretty good...
          
          The bell RINGS.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Fine.  Go do something repugnant and 
                    give us something to talk about next 
                    week.
          
          INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY
          
          Several pairs of tutors and students sit at the various 
          desks.
          
          Mandella sits with TREVOR, a White Rasta.  She attempts to 
          get him to do geometry, but he stares at her, as if smitten
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Look, it&#39;s really easy.
          
                                 TREVOR
                    You&#39;re a freedom fighter. Be proud, 
                    sister.
          
          Mandella sets down her pencil and closes the book.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (rotely)
                    It&#39;s Mandella with two L&#39;s.  I am not 
                    related to Nelson Mandela.  I am not a 
                    political figure.  I do not live in 
                    South Africa.  My parents just spent a 
                    few too many acid trips thinking they 
                    were revolutionaries.
          
                                 TREVOR 
                    But you freed our people
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Your &quot;people&quot; are white, suburban high 
                    school boys who smoke too much hemp.  I 
                    have not freed you, Trevor.
                           (grabbing his arm 
                           dramatically)
                    Only you can free yourself.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM Bianca and Cameron sit side by side, cozy as 
          can be
          
                                 BIANCA
                    C&#39;esc ma tete. This is my head
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Right.  See?  You&#39;re ready for the 
                    quiz.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I don&#39;t want to know how to say that 
                    though.  I want to know useful things.  
                    Like where the good stores are.  How 
                    much does champagne cost?  Stuff like 
                    Chat.  I have never in my life had to 
                    point out my head to someone.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That&#39;s because it&#39;s such a nice one.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Forget French.
          
          She shuts her book and puts on a seductive smile
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    How is our little Find the Wench A Date 
                    plan progressing?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Well, there&#39;s someone I think might be 
                    --
          
          Bianca&#39;s eyes light up
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Show me
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Cameron and Bianca lean against the wall -inconspicuously. 
          Bianca plays it cool.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Give me a sign when he walks by.  And 
                    don&#39;t point.
          
          The bell RINGS.  Kids flood past.  Then Patrick saunters by 
          with Scurvy.  Cameron nudges Bianca.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    There.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Where?
          
          Out of desperation, Cameron awkwardly lunges across 
          Patrick&#39;s path.  Patrick shoves him back against the wall 
          without a thought.  Cameron lands in a THUD at Bianca&#39;s 
          feet.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I guess he didn&#39;t see me 
                           (calling after 
                           Patrick) 
                                     Some other time --
          
          Bianca watches Patrick, a wicked gleam in  her eye.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    My God, he&#39;s repulsive. He&#39;s so 
                    perfect!
          
          INT. GYM CLASS - DAY 
          
          Several volleyball games are being played.
          
          Joey and a member of his hulking entourage, approach 
          Patrick, who still manages to look cool, even in gym 
          clothes.  They pull him aside roughly.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (shrugging them 
                           off)
                    What?
          
          Joey points
          
          JOEY See that girl?
          
          Patrick follows his line of vision to Kat as she spikes the 
          ball into some poor cowboy&#39;s face.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yeah
          
                                 JOEY 
                    What do you think?
          
          Kat wins the game and high fives the others, who are scared 
          of her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Two legs, nice rack...
          
                                 JOEY
                    Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out 
                    with her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Sure, Sparky.  I&#39;ll get right on it.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    You just said
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You need money to take a girl out
          
                                 JOEY
                    But you&#39;d go out with her if you had 
                    the cake?
          
          Patrick stares at Joey deadpan.  His dislike for the guy 
          obvious.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (sarcastic)
                    Yeah, I&#39;d take her to Europe if I had 
                    the plane.
          
          Joey smiles.
          
                                 JOEY
                    You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, 
                    you do the honors.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You&#39;re gonna pay me to take out some 
                    girl?
          
                                 JOEY
                    I can&#39;t date her sister until that one 
                    gets a boyfriend.  And that&#39;s the catch.  
                    She doesn&#39;t want a boyfriend.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    How much?
          
                                 JOEY
          
          Twenty bucks each time you take her out.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I can&#39;t take a girl like that out on 
                    twenty bucks.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Fine, thirty.
          
          Patrick raises an eyebrow, urging him up
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    Take it or leave it.  This isn&#39;t a 
                    negotiation.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Fifty, and you&#39;ve got your man.
          
          Patrick walks away with a smile
          
          EXT. FIELD HOCKEY FIELD - DAY
          
          Kat and the rest of the team go through a grueling practice 
          session.  Kat spares no one as she whips the ball all over 
          the field.
          
          Patrick sits on the bleachers nearby, watching.  A cigarette 
          dangles from his mouth.  His pal, SCURVY is next to him.
          
          MR. CHAPIN, the coach, blows the WHISTLE.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                           (proudly) 
                    Good run, Stratford.
          
          Kat nods in response, and the girls leave the field. Patrick 
          hops down to follow.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Hey. Girlie.
          
          Kat stops and turns slowly to look at him.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin&#39;?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (smiles brightly)
                    Sweating like a pig, actually.  And 
                    yourself?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    There&#39;s a way to get a guy&#39;s attention.
          
                                 KAT
                    My mission in life.
          
          She stands there undaunted, hand on hip.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Obviously, I&#39;ve struck your fancy. So, 
                    you see, it worked.  The world makes 
                    sense again.
          
          Patrick&#39;s eyes narrow.  He steps closer.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Pick you up Friday, then
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, right.  Friday.
          
          PATRICK backs up a little.  He uses his most seductive tone
          
                                 PATRICK
                    The night I take you to places you&#39;ve 
                    never been before.  And back.
          
                                 KAT
                    Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside?  
                    Do you even know my name, screwboy?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I know a lot more than that
          
          Kat stares at him.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Doubtful.  Very doubtful.
          
          She walks away quickly, leaving him standing alone.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (calling after her)
                    You&#39;re no bargain either, sweetheart.
          
          Scurvy appears at his side
          
                                 SCURVY
                    So I guess the Jeep won&#39;t be getting a 
                    new Blaupunkt.
          
          ACROSS THE FIELD Cameron and Michael watch.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    He took the bait.
          
          STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kat washes her face at the sink.  Bianca appears behind her, 
          and attempts to twist Kat&#39;s hair into a chignon.
          
          She wacks Bianca away.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Have you ever considered a new look? I 
                    mean, seriously, you could have some 
                    potential buried under all this 
                    hostility.
          
          Kat pushes past her into the hallway.
          
                                 KAT
                    I have the potential to smack the crap 
                    out of you if you don&#39;t get out of my 
                    way.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can you at least start wearing a bra?
          
          Kat SLAMS her door in response.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
          
          Patrick, Scurvy and some other randoms head for the exit
          
          SCURVY You up for a burger?
          
          Patrick looks in his wallet.  It&#39;s empty.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Kat stands at her locker, gathering her books.  Patrick 
          appears at her side, smiling.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Hey
          
          Kat doesn&#39;t answer
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    You hate me don&#39;t you?
          
                                 KAT
                    I don&#39;t really think you warrant that 
                    strong an emotion.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Then say you&#39;ll spend Dollar Night at 
                    the track with me.
          
                                 KAT 
                    And why would I do that?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, 
                    you with money in your eyes, me with my 
                    hand on your ass...
          
                                 KAT
                    You -- covered in my vomit.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Seven-thirty?
          
          She slams her locker shut and walks away
          
          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT
          
          Kat emerges from a music store carrying a bag of CDs in  her 
          teeth, and fumbling through her purse with both hands.  She 
          finds her keys and pulls them out with a triumphant tug.
          
          She looks up and finds Patrick sitting on the hood of her 
          car
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Nice ride. Vintage fenders.
          
          Kat takes the bag out of her mouth.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Are you following me?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I was in the laundromat. I saw your 
                    car. Thought I&#39;d say hi.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Hi
          
          She gets in and starts the car.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You&#39;re not a big talker, are you?
          
                                 KAT
                    Depends on the topic. My fenders don&#39;t 
                    really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
          
          She starts to pull out, and is blocked by Joey&#39;s Viper, 
          which pulls up perpendicular to her rear and parks.
          
          Joey and his groupies emerge and head for the liquor store
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Hey -- do you mind?
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Not at all
          
          They continue on into the store.  Kat stares at them in 
          disbelief...
          
          Then BACKS UP
          
          Her vintage fenders CRASH into the door of Joey&#39;s precious 
          Viper.
          
          Patrick watches with a delighted grin Joey races out of the 
          liquor store.
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing) 
                    You fucking bitch!
          
          Kat pulls forward and backs into his car again.  Smiling 
          sweetly.
          
          INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT 
          
          Walter paces as Kat sits calmly on the couch.
          
                                 WALTER
                    My insurance does not cover PMS
          
                                 KAT
                    Then tell them I had a seizure.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You 
                    punishing me?
          
                                 KAT
                    I thought you were punishing me.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Why can&#39;t we agree on this?
          
                                 KAT
                    Because you&#39;re making decisions for me.
          
                                 WALTER
                    As a parent, that&#39;s my right
          
                                 KAT
                    So what I want doesn&#39;t matter?
          
                                 WALTER
                    You&#39;re eighteen.  You don&#39;t know what 
                    you want.  You won&#39;t know until you&#39;re 
                    forty-five and you don&#39;t have it.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (emphatic)
                    I want to go to an East Coast school! I 
                    want you to trust me to make my own 
                    choices.  I want --
          
          Walter&#39;s BEEPER goes off
          
                                 WALTER
                    Christ!  I want a night to go by that 
                    I&#39;m not staring a contraction in the 
                    face.
          
          He walks out, leaving Kat stewing on the couch.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Patrick shuts his graffiti-encrusted locker, revealing 
          Joey&#39;s angry visage, glowering next to him.
          
                                 JOEY
                    When I shell out fifty, I expect 
                    results.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I&#39;m on it
          
                                 JOEY
                    Watching the bitch trash my car doesn&#39;t 
                    count as a date.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I got her under control. She just acts 
                    crazed in public to keep up the image.
          
          Joey sees through the bluff
          
                                 JOEY
                    Let me put it to you this way, if you 
                    don&#39;t get any action, I don&#39;t get any 
                    action.  So get your ass on hers by the 
                    end of the week.
          
          Joey starts to walk off
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I just upped my price
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (turning)
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    A hundred bucks a date.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Forget it.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Forget her sister, then.
          
          Joey thinks for a frustrated moment, PUNCHES  the locker,  
          then peels another fifty out of his wallet with a  menacing 
          scowl.
          
                                 JOEY
                    You better hope you&#39;re as smooth as you 
                    think you are, Verona.
          
          Patrick takes the money with a smile.

                    A &quot;copine&quot; is someone you can count on.  
                    An &quot;ami&quot; is someone who makes promises 
                    he can&#39;t keep.
          
          Cameron closes the French book
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You got something on your mind?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I counted on you to help my cause. You 
                    and that thug are obviously failing.  
                    Aren&#39;t we ever going on our date?
          
          He melts
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You have my word.  As a gentleman
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You&#39;re sweet.
          
          She touches his hand. He blushes at her praise and watches 
          her toss her hair back
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (appreciative)
                    How do you get your hair to look like 
                    that?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Eber&#39;s Deep Conditioner every two days.  
                    And I never, ever use a blowdryer 
                    without the diffuser attachment.
          
          Cameron nods with interest.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You know, I read an article about that.
          
          Bianca looks surprised.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You did?
          
          INT. BOY&#39;S ROOM - DAY
          
          Patrick stands at the sink, washing his hands Michael and 
          Cameron cower in the corner, watching him.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (without turning 
                           around) 
                    Say it
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (clearing his 
                           throat) 
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Whatever the hell it is you&#39;re standin&#39; 
                    there waitin&#39; to say.
          
          Cameron bravely steps forward
          
                                 CAMERON
                    We wanted to talk to you about the 
                    plan.
          
          Patrick turns toward them.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    What plan?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    The situation is, my man Cameron here 
                    has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What is it with this chick?  She have 
                    three tits?
          
          Cameron starts to object, but Michael holds up a hand.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I think I speak correctly when I say 
                    that Cameron&#39;s love is pure.  Purer than 
                    say -- Joey Dorsey&#39;s.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I&#39;m 
                    just in this for the cash.
          
          Cameron starts choking at the thought of Joey plowing his 
          beloved Bianca.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    That&#39;s where we can help you.  With 
                    Kat.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    So Dorsey can get the girl?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Patrick, Pat, you&#39;re not looking at the 
                    big picture.  Joey&#39;s just a pawn. We set 
                    this whole thing up so Cameron can get 
                    the girl.
          
          Patrick smiles.  He likes the idea of Joey being a pawn in 
          this game.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You two are gonna help me tame the wild 
                    beast?
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (grinning) 
                    We&#39;re your guys.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    And he means that strictly in a non- 
                    prison-movie type of way.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Yeah -- we&#39;ll see.
          
          He swings the door open and exits, leaving Michael and 
          Cameron grinning at each other.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    We&#39;re in.

          night bash at his abode.  Casual attire&quot;.
          
          Michael holds the invitation up to Cameron.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    This is it.  A golden opportunity. 
                    Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    In that case, we&#39;ll need to make it a 
                    school-wide blow out.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Will Bogey get bent?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Are you kidding?  He&#39;ll piss himself 
                    with joy.  He&#39;s the ultimate kiss ass.
          
          CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          Michael hands a jock the party invite as they pass each

          The cheerleader calls a White Rasta that she&#39;s making out 
          with, showing him the invite.

          Joey stands ac his open locker with Bianca.  The locker is 
          an homage to Joey&#39;s &quot;modeling&quot; career.  Cheesy PRINT ADS of 
          him -- running in a field of daisies, petting a kitten, etc. 
          -- adorn the locker door.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Which do you like better?
          
          INSERT - HEADSHOTS of Joey.  In one, he&#39;s pouting in a white 
          shirt.  In the other, he&#39;s pouting in a black shirt.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I think I like the white shirt
          
          Joey nods thoughtfully.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    It&#39;s more
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Expensive?
          
          
                                 JOEY
                    Exactly 
                           (beat)
                    So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau&#39;s 
                    thing on Saturday?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Hopefully.
          
          He gives her his best flirtatious smile
          
                                 JOEY
                    Good, &#39;cause I&#39;m not gonna bother if 
                    you won&#39;t be there.
          
          He taps her on the nose and she giggles
          
          INT. TUTORING ROOM 
          Bianca sits across from Cameron, who&#39;s transfixed, as always
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Have you heard about Bogey Lowenstein&#39;s 
                    party?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Sure have.

                           (pouting)
                    I really, really, really wanna go, but 
                    I can&#39;t.  Not unless my sister goes.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I&#39;m workin&#39; on it. But she doesn&#39;t seem 
                    to be goin&#39; for him.
          
          He fishes.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing) 
                    She&#39;s not a...
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of 
                    Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I&#39;m 
                    pretty sure she&#39;s not harboring same-sex 
                    tendencies.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So that&#39;s the kind of guy she likes? 
                    Pretty ones?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Who knows?  All I&#39;ve ever heard her say 
                    is that she&#39;d dip before dating a guy 
                    that smokes.
          
          Cameron furiously takes notes
          
                                 CAMERON
                    All right.  What else is she partial 
                    to?
          
          INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT 
          Patrick plays pool with some random deviant cronies.
          
          He looks up when he hears a COMMOTION at the door.  LOU the 
          bouncer is in the midst of throwing Michael and Cameron out.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Lou, it&#39;s okay.  They&#39;re with me.
          
          Lou looks at Patrick, surprised, then reluctantly lets our 
          two non-deviants pass through.
          
          Patrick guides them to a table and sips from a beer.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    What&#39;ve you got for me?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I&#39;ve retrieved certain pieces of 
                    information on Miss Katarina Stratford I 
                    think you&#39;ll find helpful.
          
          Cameron pulls out a piece of paper.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (to Patrick)
          
          One question before we start -- should you be drinking 
          alcohol when you don&#39;t have a liver?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What?!
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Good enough.
          
          Cameron looks up at Patrick.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Number one.  She hates smokers
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    It&#39;s a lung cancer issue
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Her favorite uncle
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Dead at forty-one.
          
          Patrick sits up
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Are you telling me I&#39;m a - 
                           (spits the word 
                           out)

                                 CAMERON
                    Another thing.  Bianca said that Kat 
                    likes -- pretty guys.
          
          This is met with silence.  Then:
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What?  You don&#39;t think I&#39;m pretty?

                    He&#39;s pretty!
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Okay!  I wasn&#39;t sure
          
          Cameron goes back to the list.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist 
                    prose, and &quot;angry, stinky girl music of 
                    the indie-rock persuasion&quot;.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So what does that give me?  I&#39;m 
                    supposed to buy her some noodles and a 
                    book and sit around listening to chicks 
                    who can&#39;t play their instruments?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Ever been to Club Skunk?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yeah.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow 
                    night.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Don&#39;t make me do it, man
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Assail your ears for one night.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    It&#39;s her favorite band.
          
          Patrick groans
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I also retrieved a list of her most 
                    recent CD purchases, courtesy of 
                    American Express.
          
          He hands it over.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (smiling)
                    Michael -- did you get this information 
                    &quot;illegally&quot;?
          
          Michael puts a finger to his lips.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I prefer to think of it simply as an 
                    alternative to what the law allows.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I&#39;m likin&#39; you guys better
          
          He looks down at the list of CDs.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    This is really music?
          
          INT. KAT&#39;S ROOM - NIGHT
          
          MUSIC BLARES in a room with minimalist decor splashed with 
          indie rock band posters and flyers.
          
          Kat and Mandella dance as they dress and apply make-up 
          Bianca enters, interrupting their fun.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can you turn down the Screaming 
                    Menstrual Bitches?  I&#39;m trying to study.
          
          Kat doesn&#39;t move, so Bianca crosses to the stereo, turning 
          down the volume.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re actually going 
                    out?  On a school night, no less.
          
          Kat shoots her a glare
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing; 
                           excited)
                    Oh my God, does this mean you&#39;re 
                    becoming normal?
          
                                 KAT
                    It means that Gigglepuss is playing at 
                    Club Skunk and we&#39;re going.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (disappointed)
                    Oh, I thought you might have a date
                           (beat)
                    I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m bothering to ask, 
                    but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein&#39;s 
                    party Saturday night?
          
                                 KAT
                    What do you think?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I think you&#39;re a freak.  I think you do 
                    this to torture me.  And I think you 
                    suck.
          
          She smiles sweetly and shuts the door behind her.   Kat 
          doesn&#39;t bat an eye.  She grabs her purse and opens the door
          
                                 KAT 
                    Let&#39;s hit it.
          
          EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT
          
          A happy black and white neon skunk sprays fine mist on the 
          line of kids below.
          
          INT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Kat and Mandella walk in, Mandella nervously pulling out her 
          fake ID.  The giant, afroed bouncer, BRUCE, looks typically 
          mono-syllabic.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (whispering to Kat) 
                    You think this&#39;ll work?
          
                                 KAT 
                    No fear.
          
          They approach Bruce.  Kat puts on her happy, shiny face
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Hello!  We&#39;d like two for Gigglepuss!
          
          Bruce looks the girls up and down.
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    I can count.
          
          He looks at their IDs. Mandella gently moves Kat aside, 
          wearing a face that could only be described as &quot;I AM a 
          Victoria&#39;s Secret model.&quot;
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                    I&#39;ll bet you can..
          
          She sticks out her chest and licks her lips.  Bruce stares 
          at her deadpan and hands her back the IDs.
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    Go ahead.
                           (to Mandella)
                    And you
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (all come hither)
                    Yes?
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Take it easy on the guys in there.
          
          Mandella winks at him and sashays inside   Kat: follows 
          behind, shaking her head.
          
          EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT 
          
          Patrick&#39;s mail truck clatters to a stop out front.
          
          INT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Patrick walks up to Bruce, who&#39;s frisking a badly mowhawked 
          PIERCED EYEBROW BOY.  Bruce pulls a SWITCHBLADE out of the 
          boy&#39;s inside pocket.
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Next time, leave the Bic at home, 
                    Skippy.
          
                                 SKIPPY
                    It&#39;s a bottle opener.
          
          Bruce pushes him inside the club, then sees Patrick.
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    Verona, my man.
          
          They shake.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Always a pleasure, Brucie.
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Didn&#39;t have you pegged for a Gigglepuss 
                    fan.  Aren&#39;t they a little too pre-teen 
                    belly-button ring for you?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of 
                    minors come in?
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Never
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. 
                    The other one kinda short and 
                    undersexed?
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    Just sent &#39;em through.
          
          Patrick starts to go in
          
                                 BRUCE 
                           (continuing)
                    Hey -- what happened to that chick you 
                    brought last time?  The one with the 
                    snake?
          
          Patrick laughs and goes into the club
          
          INT. CLUB - NIGHT
          
          Onstage, the all-female band GIGGLEPUSS is parlaying their 
          bad girl sass into a ripping punk number.
          
          Near the stage is a joyful mass of pogo-ing teens AT THE BAR
          
          Patrick bellies up and looks around the club. Gigglepuss 
          finishes a song.
          
                                 LEAD SINGER
                    Hello, out there.  We&#39;re Gigglepuss and 
                    we&#39;re from Olympia.
          
          A teenage boy in the audience takes the opportunity to 
          scream.
          
                                 BOY (0.S.)
                    Pet my kitty!
          
                                 LEAD SINGER 
                    Meow
          
          They rev into their next song. 
          
          NEAR THE STAGE  
          
          Mandella and Kat glow with sweat.  When they hear the 
          opening chords of the song, they look at each other and 
          scream with glee as they begin to dance.  They couldn&#39;t be 
          having a better time.
          
          AT THE BAR
          
          Patrick signals to get the bartender&#39;s attention and looks 
          across the bouncing surge of the crowd.  He spots Kat and 
          Mandella singing along.
          
          HIS POV
          
          The gleeful Kat -- dancing and looking completely at ease. 
          None of her usual &quot;attitude&quot;.  Patrick is transfixed.  And 
          most definitely attracted.
          
          NEAR THE STAGE Kat looks at Mandella.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (shouting)
                    I need agua!
          
          She makes her way through the crowd to the bar. AT THE BAR
          
          She made it.  She signals for the bartender and as she&#39;s 
          waiting, looks around.  She spots Patrick a few feet away
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing to 
                           herself) 
                    Shit
          
          She sneaks a glance.  He&#39;s staring, but this time he looks 
          away before she can.  Despite herself, she&#39;s miffed.
          
          The bartender arrives
          
          BARTENDER 
                           (shouting) 
                    What can I get you?
          
                                 KAT 
                    Two waters.
          
          She looks at Patrick again.  He&#39;s completely absorbed in the 
          band.  She scowls.  The bottled water arrives and she 
          marches off, forgetting to pay.
          
          She walks up to Patrick.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing) 
                    You&#39;re not fooling anyone.
          
          Patrick looks at her, surprised
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling) 
                    hey.  Great show, huh?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling)
          
          If you&#39;re planning on asking me out you might as well get it 
          over with.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling) 
                    Excuse me?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling)
                    That&#39;s what you want, isn&#39;t it?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling; gesturing 
                           toward the band)
                    Do you mind?  You&#39;re sort of ruining it 
                    for me.
          
          Kat steams.  And watches him watch the band
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling)
                    You&#39;re not surrounded by your usual 
                    cloud of smoke.
          
          The band takes a break, so they can stop yelling now
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I know.  I quit.
          
          He leans back, making no attempt to hit on her.  She moves 
          closer.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Oh, really?
          
          He motions toward the stage
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill 
                    or The Raincoats, but they&#39;re right up 
                    there.
          
                                 KAT
                    You know who The Raincoats are?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Why, don&#39;t you?
          
          She&#39;s completely taken aback.  He uses the moment to his 
          advantage and brushes her hair back as he speaks right into 
          her ear.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    I watched you out there   I&#39;ve never 
                    seen you look like that
          
          Kat steps away, brushing the hair back that he just touched 
          Her cheeks pinken.
          
          His cocky side is back in a flash
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    Come to that party with me.
          
          At that moment, the band starts another SONG
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling) 
                    What?
          
          The bartender approaches.
          
          BARTENDER 
                           (to Kat, yelling) 
                    You forgot to pay!
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling) 
                    I got it, Rick.
          
          He tosses some bills on the bar
          
          Rather than thank him, Kat simply watches him, trying to 
          figure out his motive.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing; 
                           yelling) 
                    Nine-thirty then.
          
          A few people have gotten between them at the bar and she 
          can&#39;t hear a word he&#39;s saying.  She gives him one last look 
          and heads back into the crowd.
          
          Patrick smiles.  She didn&#39;t say no this time.
          
          EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT
          
          The crowd files out of the club, Kat and Mandella amongst 
          them.  A^ they&#39;re walking toward the parking lot, Patrick 
          coasts by in his truck.  The gears GRIND.  He yells out the 
          window.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                    What&#39;d he say?
          
                                 KAT 
                    Who cares?
          
          Mandella watches Kat as she stares after Patrick
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Has he importun&#39;d you with love in 
                    honourable fashion?
          
          Kat glances sharply at her.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (continuing; off 
                           her look)
                    Don&#39;t be Cruella with me.  I&#39;m in favor 
                    of romance.  You&#39;re the one that wants 
                    to march on Washington every five 
                    minutes.
          
          Kat pokes her, then looks back at the club dreamily.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Gigglepuss was so beyond.
          
          Mandella nods.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    They were.  I only wish William could 
                    have been here to witness the rebirth of 
                    punk rock with us.
          
          Kat links her arm through Mandella&#39;s and they head for the 
          car.
          
                                 KAT
                    So true.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
          Cameron and Michael are at Michael&#39;s locker.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So, then she says that she almost 
                    didn&#39;t wear the Kenneth Coles with that 
                    dress because she thought she was 
                    mixing, you know, genres. And the fact 
                    that I noticed -- and I&#39;m quoting here -
                    &quot;really meant something.&quot;
          
          Cameron looks At Michael expectantly
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    You told me that part already.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Hell, I&#39;ve just been going over the 
                    whole thing in my head and -
          
          Joey appears over Cameron&#39;s shoulder.  
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Hey.  Dingo Boingo
          
          Cameron and Michael look at each other And turn around 
          slowly
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing; to 
                           Michael)
                    I hear you&#39;re helpin&#39; Verona.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Uh,  yeah.  We&#39;re old friend*
          
                                 JOEY 
                    You and Verona?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    What?  We took bathes together when we 
                    were kids.
          
          It&#39;s incredibly obvious that he&#39;s lying.  Joey eyes him then 
          turns to Cameron.
          
                                 JOEY
                    What&#39;s your gig in all this?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I&#39;m just the new guy.
          
          Joey turns back to Michael, grabbing the alligator on his 
          shirt and twisting it.
          
                                 JOEY
                    You better not fuck this up.  I&#39;m 
                    heavily invested.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey -- it&#39;s all for the higher good 
                    right?
          
          Joey lets go of Michael and SHOVES Cameron against a locker 
          for good measure, as he walks away-
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Is it about me?
          
          EXT. MISS PERKY&#39;S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Kat sits outside waiting for her appointment, bored and 
          annoyed.
          
          The door opens and Miss Perky escorts Patrick out
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    You&#39;re completely demented.
          
                                 PATRICK
                           (cheery)
                    See you next week!
          
          Kat stands and Patrick sees her.
          
          Miss Perky watches in horror
          
          MISS PERKY
          You two know each other?
          
                                 PATRICK/KAT 
                    Yeah/No.
          
          Miss Perky grabs Kat and shoves her into her office.
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                           (to Patrick)
                    Dear God, stay away from her.  If you 
                    two ever decided to breed, evil would 
                    truly walk the earth.
          
          Patrick gives Kat one last look before the door shuts, then 
          smiles-
          
          EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT 
          
          The lights are on, illuminating the yard
          
          INT.  STRATFORD HOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Bianca and Chastity stand outside Kat&#39;s room.  MUSIC is 
          blaring and the door is shut.  Bianca looks at her watch
          
                                 BIANCA
                    She&#39;s obviously not going.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Across the carpet, two pairs of teenage girl feet sneak 
          past.  Bianca and Chastity, teddy bear purses in hand.
          
          FROM THE KITCHEN A RUSTLING is heard.  The girls freeze.
          
          Walter emerges from the kitchen with a mile-high sandwich 
          The girls are like statues.  Walter jumps.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, I --
          
                                 WALTER
                    And where&#39;re you going?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    If you must know, we were attempting to 
                    go to a small study group of friends.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Otherwise known as an orgy?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    It&#39;s just a party. Daddy, but I knew 
                    you&#39;d forbid me to go since &quot;Gloria 
                    Steinem&quot; over there isn&#39;t going --
          
          She points to Kat -- Walkman blaring -- who comes 
          downstairs, wearing a baby tee and battered Levis.  Her 
          relaxing-at-home look is about 400 times sexier than her at-
          school look.  She wanders toward the kitchen.
          
          Walter directs his attention toward Kat.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Do you know about any party? Katarina?
          
          Kat shrugs as she comes back out of the kitchen with an 
          apple
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, people expect me to be there!
          
                                 WALTER
                    If Kat&#39;s not going, you&#39;re not going.
          
          Bianca turns to Kat, eyes ablaze
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You&#39;re ruining my life&#39;  Because you 
                    won&#39;t be normal, I can&#39;t be normal.
          
                                 KAT 
                    What&#39;s normal?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Bogey Lowenstein&#39;s party is normal, but 
                    you&#39;re too busy listening to Bitches Who 
                    Need Prozac to know that.
          
                                 WALTER
                    What&#39;s a Bogey Lowenstein?
          
          Kat takes off her earphones, ready to do battle
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can&#39;t you forget for just one night 
                    that you&#39;re completely wretched?
          
                                 KAT
                    At least I&#39;m not a clouted fen- sucked 
                    hedge-pig.
          
          Bianca tosses her hair.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Like I&#39;m supposed to know what that 
                    even means.
          
                                 KAT
                    It&#39;s Shakespeare.  Maybe you&#39;ve heard 
                    of him?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Yeah, he&#39;s your freak friend Mandella&#39;s 
                    boyfriend.  I guess since I&#39;m not 
                    allowed to go out, I should obsess over 
                    a dead guy, too.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Girls
          
          Kat stares Bianca down
          
                                 KAT
                    I know about the goddamn party.  I&#39;m 
                    going.
          
          Bianca and Chastity look at each other, thrilled, and burst 
          into gleeful screams.
          
          A startled Walter clutches Bianca in a protective hug.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Oh, God.  It&#39;s starting.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    It&#39;s just a party. Daddy.
          
          Walter looks dazed.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Wear the belly before you go.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, no!
          
                                 WALTER
                    Just for a minute
          
          He rushes to a cupboard and pulls out a padded faux-
          pregnancy belly.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    I want you to realize the weight of 
                    your decisions.
          
          He hangs the belly on her as she stands mortified.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You are so completely unbalanced.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Can we go now?

                           (to Bianca)
                    Promise me you won&#39;t talk to any boys 
                    unless your sister is present.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Why?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Because she&#39;ll scare them away.
          
          Kat stomps to the door, grabbing her car keys off the hall 
          table and a sweater from the coat rack. She flings open the 
          door and...
          
          There stands Patrick.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Nine-thirty right?
          
          Kat&#39;s in shock
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    I&#39;m early.
          
          She holds up her keys
          
                                 KAT 
                    I&#39;m driving.
          
          He peeks in behind her.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Who knocked up your sister?
          
          INT. BOGEY LOWENSTEIN&#39;S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          BOGEY, a short Future MBA in a tux, greets his guests like a 
          pro, handing out cigars and martinis.
          
                                 BOGEY
                    Nice to see you.  Martini bar to the 
                    right, shots in the kitchen.
          
          The house is filled to capacity with Padua High&#39;s finest Kat 
          pushes through the crowd.  Patrick saunters in behind her
          
          INT. BOGEY&#39;S KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Joey lines up a row of shots amid much whooping and 
          hollering within the jock crowd.
          
          Kat enters, then quickly tries to make an about face.  Joey 
          sees her and rushes over to block her, standing in the 
          doorway.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Lookin&#39; fresh tonight, Pussy-Kat
          
          Kat gives him a death look and then stops and points at his 
          forehead.
          
                                 KAT
                    Wait -- was that?-- Did your hairline 
                    just recede?
          
          He panics, whipping out a handy pocket mirror   She&#39;s 
          already walking away.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Where ya goin?
          
                                 KAT
                    Away.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Your sister here?
          
          Kat&#39;s face shows utter hatred
          
                                 KAT 
                    Leave my sister alone.
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (smirking) 
                    And why would I do that?
          
          A RUCKUS sounds from the next room
          
                                 JOCK 
                    A fight!
          
          The other jocks rush to watch as two Coffee Kids splash 
          their cupfuls on each other.
          
                                 COFFEE KID #1
                    That was a New Guinea Peaberry, you 
                    Folger&#39;s-crystals-slurping-buttwipe.
          
          Caffeinated fists fly.  Joey slithers away from the door to 
          watch, giving Kat one last smirk, just as Bianca walks into 
          the kitchen.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Just who I was looking for.
          
          He puts his arm around Bianca and escorts her out
          
                                 KAT 
                                 BIANCA
          
          Bianca keeps walking, ignoring Kat
          
          A GUY pouring shots hands Kat one She downs it and accepts 
          another.
          
          GUY
          Drink up, sister.
          
          Patrick walks up
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What&#39;s this?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (mocking)
                    &quot;I&#39;m getting trashed, man.&quot; Isn&#39;t that 
                    what you&#39;re supposed to do at a party?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I say, do what you wanna do.
          
                                 KAT
                    Funny, you&#39;re the only one
          
          She downs another.
          
          INT. BOGEY&#39;S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Cameron and Michael enter.  Cameron looks, around for his 
          beloved, while Michael schmoozee with all in attendance and 
          dishes dirt simultaneously.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (high-fiving a 
                           jock)
                    Moose, my man! 
                           (to Cameron)
                    Ranked fifth in the state. Recruiters 
                    have already started calling.
          
          Cameron nods intently
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (continuing; 
                           grabbing his belt)
                    Yo, Clem. 
                           (to Cameron)
                    A Patsy Cline fan, but hates the new 
                    Leanne Rimes. 
                           (with a Jamaican 
                           swagger)
                    Ziggy, peace, bra. 
                           (to Cameron)
                    Prefers a water pipe, but has been 
                    known to use a bong.
          
          Michael spots Bianca and Chastity, watching the skirmish, 
          and points Cameron&#39;s body in her direction.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (continuing)
                    Follow the love, man
          
          ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY Bianca cranes her neck
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Where did he go?  He was just here.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Who?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Joey.
          
          Cameron walks over.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Evening, ladies.
          
          Bianca turns and graces him with a pained smile.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Hi.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Looks like things worked out tonight, 
                    huh?
          
          Bianca ignores the question and tries to pawn him off
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You know Chastity?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I believe we share an art instructor
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Great
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Would you mind getting me a drink, 
                    Cameron?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Certainly
                    Pabst?  Old Milwaukee? RaiJieer?
          
          Bianca gives him a tense smile.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Surprise me.
          
          He heads for the kitchen.  Joey walks up and grabs her 
          around the waist.
          
          She giggles as he picks her up and carries her off -- just 
          as Cameron returns, a beer -- complete with a napkin and 
          straw -- in his hand.
          
          Chastity glares with a jealous fury after Bianca and Joey, 
          then gives Cameron the once-over and walks away.
          
          Michael appears.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    The hell is that?  What kind of &#39;guy 
                    just picks up a girl and carries her 
                    away while you&#39;re talking to her?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you&#39;re 
                    making progress.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    No, I &#39; m not.
          
          He smacks himself in the head
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    She used me!  She wants to go out with 
                    Dorsey.  Not me.  I&#39;m an idiot!
          
          Michael pats him on the shoulder.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    At least you&#39;re self-aware
          
          BOGEY&#39;S KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Kat and a crowd of White Rastas and Cowboys stand in a 
          drunken group hug singing &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot;.  Kat has 
          another shot glass in hand.
          
          Patrick is showing a scar to an inebriated, enraptured 
          cheerleader.  He looks up at Kat and smiles meets his eyes 
          then looks away.
          
          INT. BOGEY&#39;S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
          
          Bianca stands next to Joey, sipping from her beer
          
                                 JOEY
                    So yeah, I&#39;ve got the Sears catalog 
                    thing going -- and the tube sock gig &quot; 
                    that&#39;s gonna be huge.  And then I&#39;m up 
                    for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Queen Harry?
          
                                 JOEY
                    It&#39;s a gay cruise line, but I&#39;ll be, 
                    like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
          
          Bianca tries to appear impressed, but it&#39;s getting 
          difficult.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Neat...
          
                                 JOEY
                    My agent says I&#39;ve got a good shot at 
                    being the Prada guy next year.
          
          He looks over her shoulder and waves at someone.  Bianca 
          takes the opportunity to escape.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I&#39;ll be right back.
          
          INT. BOGEY&#39;S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bianca shuts the door and leans on it with a sigh.  Chastity 
          applies lip-gloss in the mirror.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    He practically proposed when he found 
                    out we had the same dermatologist. I 
                    mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, 
                    but he&#39;s not exactly relevant party 
                    conversation.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Is he oily or dry?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Combination.  I don&#39;t know -- I thought 
                    he&#39;d be different.  More of a 
                    gentleman...
          
          Chastity rolls her eyes
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Bianca, I don&#39;t think the highlights of 
                    dating Joey Dorsey are going to include 
                    door-opening and coat-holding.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Sometimes I wonder if the guys we&#39;re 
                    supposed to want to go out with are the 
                    ones we actually want to go out with, 
                    you know?
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    All I know is -- I&#39;d give up my private 
                    line to go out with a guy like Joey.
          
          There&#39;s a KNOCK at the door.  Bianca opens it to find a very 
          drunken Kat.
          
                                 KAT
                    Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need 
                    to tell you --
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (cutting her off)
                    I really don&#39;t think I need any social 
                    advice from you right now.
          
          Bianca grabs Chastity&#39;s arm and they exit
          
          INT. BOGEY&#39;S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER 
          
          Patrick tries to remove a shot glass from Kat&#39;s hand.
          
                                 PATRICK
          
          Maybe you should let me have it.
          
          Kat is fierce in her refusal to let go
          
                                 KAT
                    I want another one
          
          Joey enters, grabbing Patrick by the shoulder, distracting 
          him from his task.
          
                                 JOEY
                    My man
          
          As Patrick turns, Kat breaks free and dives into the sea of 
          dancing people in the dining room.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (annoyed)
                    It&#39;s about time.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    A deal&#39;s a deal.
          
          He peels off some bills
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    How&#39;d you do it?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Do what?
          
                                 JOEY
                    Get her to act like a human
          
          A very drunken Kat jumps up onto the kitchen island and 
          starts dancing by herself.  She lets loose, hair flying. 
          She&#39;s almost burlesque.
          
          Others form a crowd, clapping and cheering her on
          
          She swings her head around BANGING it on a copper pot 
          hanging from the rack above the center island.  She starts 
          to sway, then goes down as Patrick rushes over to catch her.
          
          The others CLAP, thinking this is a wonderful finale. 
          Patrick sets her down on her feet, holding her up
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Okay?
          
                                 KAT
                    I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m
          
          She tries to push him away, but staggers when she does grabs  
          her again, bracing her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You&#39;re not okay.
          
                                 KAT
                    I just need to lie down for awhile
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Uh, uh. You lie down and you&#39;ll go to 
                    sleep
          
                                 KAT
                    I know, just let me sleep
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What if you have a concussion? My dog 
                    went to sleep with a concussion and woke 
                    up a vegetable. Not that I could tell 
                    the difference...
          
          She tries to sit on the floor
          
                                 KAT
                    Okay, I&#39;ll just sleep but stay awake, 
                    okay?
          
          He pulls her back to her
          
                                 PATRICK
                    C&#39;mon, let&#39;s walk
          
          INT. BOGEY&#39;S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          As Patrick walks Kat through the dining room, Cameron  grabs 
          his arm.
          
          CAMERON We need to talk.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Cameron, I&#39;m a little busy
          
                                 CAMERON
                    It&#39;s off. The whole thing.
          
          Kat slides down to the floor and Patrick struggles to  get h 
          back on her feet.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What &#39;re you talking about?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    She&#39;s partial to Joey, not me
          
          Patrick doesn&#39;t have time for this.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Cameron -- do you like the girl?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Sure
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (impatient)
                    Then, go get her
          
          Patrick continues walking an oblivious Kat outside. Cameron 
          stands there, unsure how to make use of this advice
          
          EXT. BOGEY LOWENSTEIN&#39;S HOUSE - NIGHT 
          
          Patrick marches Kat around the yard, holding her up
          
                                 KAT
                    This is so patronizing.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Leave it to you to use big words when 
                    you&#39;re shitfaced.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why &#39;re you doing this?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I told you
          
                                 KAT
                    You don&#39;t care if I die
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Sure, I do
          
                                 KAT
                    Why?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Because then I&#39;d have to start taking 
                    out girls who like me.
          
                                 KAT
                    Like you could find one
          
                                 PATRICK
                    See that?  Who needs affection when 
                    I&#39;ve got blind hatred?
          
                                 KAT
                    Just let me sit down.
          
          He walks her over to the swingset and plops her down in a 
          swing, moving her hands to hang onto the chains.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    How&#39;s that?
          
          She sits and looks at him for a moment with a smile. Then 
          FALLS over backward.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Jesus.  You&#39;re like a weeble
          
          Patrick rushes to right her, then starts pushing her on the 
          swing to keep her entertained.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Why&#39;d you let him get to you?
          
                                 KAT
                    Who? 
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Dorsey.
          
                                 KAT
                    I hate him.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I know.  It&#39;d have to be a pretty big 
                    deal to get you to mainline tequila. You 
                    don&#39;t seem like the type.
          
                                 KAT
                           (holding up a 
                           drunken head)
                    Hey man. . .  You don &#39; t think I can 
                    be &quot;cool&quot;?  You don&#39;t think I can be 
                    &quot;laid back&quot; like everyone else?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (slightly 
                           sarcastic)
                    I thought you were above all that
          
                                 KAT
                    You know what they say
          
          He stops the swing
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No. What do they say?
          
          Kat is asleep, her head resting against the swing&#39;s chains.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Shit!
          
          He drags her to her feet and starts singing loudly.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Jingle Bells! Jingle Belles! Wake up 
                    damn it!
          
          He sits her down on the slide and shakes her like a rag 
          doll.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Kat! Wake up!  
          
                                 KAT
                           (waking)
                    What?
          
          He sighs with relief.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I thought you were...
          
          They share some meaningful eye contact. And then she PUKES 
          on his shoes.
          
          INT. BOGEY&#39;S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kat washes her face and grabs a bottle of Scope, taking a 
          big swig.
          
          A KNOCK sounds at the door
          
                                 KAT
                    Go away
          
          Bianca opens the door and looks at her sister with the 
          smuggest of all possible grins.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Dinner taste better on the way out?
          
          Gives her a &quot;don&#39;t even start&quot; look.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    I don&#39;t get you.  You act like you&#39;re 
                    too good for any of this, and then you 
                    go totally apeshit when you get here.
          
                                 KAT
                    You&#39;re welcome.
          
          She pushes past her and leaves the bathroom.
          
          KAT&#39;S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Kat&#39;s in the driver&#39;s seat.  Patrick leans in and takes the 
          keys out of the ignition.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Cute
          
          BOGEY LOWENSTEIN&#39;S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Kids loiter on the lawn.  Bianca and Chastity walk outside 
          Joey catches up to them.
          
                                 JOEY
                    A bunch of us are going to Jaret&#39;s 
                    house.  Wanna come?
          
          Chastity looks at Bianca, who wears a pained expression.  
          She looks at her watch.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I have to be home in twenty minutes.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                           (eagerly, to Joey)
                    I don&#39;t have to be home &#39;til two.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Then, c&#39;mon.
                           (to Bianca)
                    Maybe next time --
          
          They head back into the party, leaving an astonished Bianca
          
          Cameron exits the party and stops when he sees Bianca 
          standing alone.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (slightly 
                           accusatory)
                    Have fun tonight?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Tons
          
          He starts to walk on
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    Cameron?
          
          He stops. She gives him a helpless smile.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    Do you think you could give me a ride 
                    home?
          
          INT. KAT&#39;S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Patrick drives as Kat sits in the passenger seat, fiddling 
          with the radio dial.  She finds a SONG she&#39;s happy with and 
          Patrick quickly changes it.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I&#39;m driving, so I get to pick the 
                    tunes.
          
          She changes it back to her song.
          
                                 KAT
                    It&#39;s my car.
          
          He changes it back.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    And I&#39;m in control of it.
          
                                 KAT
                    But it&#39;s Gigglepuss - I know you like 
                    them.  I saw you there.
          
          Patrick doesn&#39;t have an answer for this, so he let&#39;s her 
          listen to her song.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    When you were gone last year -- where 
                    were you?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Busy
          
                                 KAT
                    Were you in jail?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Maybe.
          
                                 KAT
                    No, you weren&#39;t
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Then why&#39;d you ask?
          
                                 KAT
                    Why&#39;d you lie?
          
          He doesn&#39;t answer, but instead, frowns and turns up the 
          music.  She bobs her head drunkenly.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    I should do this.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Do what?
          
                                 KAT
                    This.
          
          She points to the radio
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Start a band?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (sarcastically)
                    My father wouldn&#39;t approve of that that
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You don&#39;t strike me as the type that 
                    would ask permission.
          
          She turns to look at him.
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, so now you think you know me?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I&#39;m gettin&#39; there
          
          Her voice loses it&#39;s venom
          
                                 KAT
                    The only thing people know about me is 
                    that I&#39;m &quot;scary&quot;.
          
          He turns to look at her -- she looks anything but scary 
          right now.  He tries to hide his smile.
          
                                 PATRICK
          
          Yeah -- well, I&#39;m no picnic myself.
          
          They eye each other, sharing a moment of connection, 
          realizing they&#39;re both created the same exterior for 
          themselves.
          
          Patrick pulls into her driveway and shuts off the motor.  He 
          looks up at her house.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    So what &#39; s up with your dad?  He a 
                    pain in the ass?
          
                                 KAT
                    He just wants me to be someone I&#39;m not.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Who?
          
                                 KAT
                                 BIANCA
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No offense, but you&#39;re sister is 
                    without.  I know everyone likes her and 
                    all, but ...
          
          Kat stares at him with new admiration.
          
                                 KAT
                    You know -- you&#39;re not as vile as I 
                    thought you were.
          
          She leans drunkenly toward him.
          
          Their faces grow closer as if they&#39;re about to kiss And then 
          Patrick turns away
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So, I&#39;ll see you in school
          
          Kat stares at him, pissed.  Then gets out of the car, 
          SLAMMING the door shut behind her.
          
          CAMERON&#39;S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Bianca and Cameron ride in silence.
          He finally breaks it.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I looked for you back at the party, but 
                    you always seemed to be &quot;occupied&quot;.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (faux-innocence )
                    I was?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You never wanted to go out with &#39;me, 
                    did you?
          
          Bianca bites her lip.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (reluctant)
                    Well, no...
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Then that&#39;s all you had to say.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You always been this selfish?
          
          BIANCA thinks a minute
          
          He pulls up in front of the house
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Just because you&#39;re beautiful, doesn&#39;t 
                    mean you can treat people like they 
                    don&#39;t matter.
          
          She looks at him for a moment -- then grabs his face and 
          gives him a kiss on the lips.  He draws back in surprise, 
          then kisses her back.  She smiles, then gets out of the car 
          without another word.
          
          Cameron grins and drives away
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    And I&#39;m back in the saddle.
          
          INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
          
          Kat sits at her desk, burying her face in a book as the 
          others enter.  The White Rastas are first.
          
                                 DEREK
                    Kat, my lady, you sway to the rhythm of 
                    my heart.
          
          He grabs her hand and kisses it as she pulls it away.
          
          CLEM, a cowboy, enters, high-fiving Derek with new-found 
          friendliness.
          
                                 CLEM
                    Yippe kai-aye, bra. 
                           (to Kat)
                    Dance for me, cowgirl.
          
          He sits next to Derek
          
                                 CLEM 
                           (continuing)
                    Okay, now tell me again why he didn&#39;t 
                    shoot the deputy?
          
                                 DEREK
                    Because the deputy meant him no harm, 
                    my friend.  It was only the sheriff that 
                    was the oppressor.
          
          Joey saunters in and takes his seat.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Kat, babe, you were on fire.
          
          Mrs. Blaise enters and sits at her desk
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    Well now, did everyone have a good 
                    weekend?
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Maybe we should ask Verona
          
          Patrick enters, late, and slinks to his desk.  Kat looks up, 
          down and around, everywhere but at Patrick.
          
          Mrs. Blaise tries to remember what she&#39;s supposed to talk 
          about.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                    Okay then.  Well.
                           (beat)
                    Oh, yes
          
          She clears her throat.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    I&#39;d like you all to write your own 
                    version of Shakespeare&#39;s Sonnet #141.
          
          Groans.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    Any form you&#39;d like.  Rhyme, no rhyme, 
                    whatever.  I&#39;d like to see you elaborate 
                    on his theme, however. Let&#39;s read it 
                    aloud, shall we? Anyone?
          
          The class is frozen in apathy.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    Derek?
          
          Ms. Blaise hands him the sonnet. He shifts uncomfortably in 
          his seat. Then grins.
          
                                 DEREK 
                           (reading; in his 
                           Rasta stoner drawl)
                    In faith, I do not love thee with mine 
                    eyes/ For they in thee a thousand errors 
                    note/ But &#39;tis my heart that loves what 
                    they despise/ Who in despite of view is 
                    pleas &#39;d to dote.
          
          In the back of the room Clem raises his hand
          
                                 CLEM
                    Ms. Blaise, can I get the bathroom 
                    pass?  Damn if Shakespeare don&#39;t act as 
                    a laxative on my person.
          
          INT. KENNY&#39;S THAI FOOD DINER - DAY 
          Kat and Mandella scrape the peanuts out of their sauce.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    You went to the party?  I thought we 
                    were officially opposed to suburban 
                    social activity.
          
                                 KAT
                    I didn&#39;t have a choice.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    You didn&#39;t have a choice?  Where&#39;s Kat 
                    and what have you done with her?
          
                                 KAT
                    I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                    You didn&#39;t
          
                                 KAT
                    I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected.  
                    It was big fun.
          
          Patrick enters, walking to the counter to order. He sees Kat 
          and smiles.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Hey
          
          She gathers her things and bolts out the door.  Patrick 
          looks at Mandella, who shrugs and follows Kat.
          
          INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY Cameron and Michael flank Patrick 
          at his lab table
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    So you got cozy with she who stings?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No - I&#39;ve got a sweet-payin&#39; job that 
                    I&#39;m about to lose.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    What&#39;d you do to her?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I don &#39; t know. 
                           (beat)
                    I decided not to nail her when she was 
                    too drunk to remember it.
          
          Michael and Cameron look at each other in realization, then 
          turn back to Patrick.
          
                                 CAMERON
          
          You realize this puts the whole operation in peril.
          
                                 PATRICK
          
          No shit.  She won&#39;t even look at me
          
                                 CAMERON
          
          Why can&#39;t you just tell her you&#39;re sorry?
          
          Patrick&#39;s expression says that this is not a possibility. 
          Michael makes a time out sign with his hands.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I&#39;m on it

          Mandella is at her locker.  Drawings of William Shakespeare 
          adorn the door.  She looks at them with a sigh, then ties 
          her silk scarf tightly around her neck, in an attempt to cut 
          off her air supply.
          
          Michael walks up.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (shyly, as she 
                           loosens the scarf)
                    Hi.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Cool pictures.  You a fan?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Yeah.  I guess.
          
          MICHAEL rocks.  Very hip.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    You think?
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Oh yeah.
          
          She looks at him suspiciously
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Who could refrain that had a heart to 
                    love and in that heart, courage to make 
                    &#39; B love known?
          
          Michael thinks for a minute.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Macbeth, right?
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (happily stunned)
                    Right.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Kat a fan, too?
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (puzzled)
                    Yeah...
          
          He leans in close to her, conspiratorially
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    So, listen... I have this friend
          
          EXT. FIELD HOCKEY FIELD - DAY
          
          Cameron sits next to Patrick on the bleachers as they watch 
          Kat&#39;s practice.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    She hates you with the fire of a 
                    thousand suns .  That&#39;s a direct quote
          
                                 PATRICK
                    She just needs time to cool off I&#39;ll 
                    give it a day.
          
          A PUCK flies at them from the field, narrowly missing their 
          heads.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Maybe two.
          
          He looks at Cameron.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    You makin&#39; any headway?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    She kissed me.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (eyebrow raised)
                    Where?

          Chastity rounds the corner and bends down to get a drink 
          from the water fountain.
          
          NEARBY
          
          Joey stands talking to two JOCK COHORTS.  The guys don&#39;t see 
          her.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Don&#39;t talk to me about the sweetest 
                    date.  That little halo Bianca is gonna 
                    be prone and proven on prom night.  Six 
                    virgins in a row.
          
          The cohorts chortle Chastity keeps drinking from the 
          fountain
          
          EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 
          
          Joey leans against Patrick&#39;s Jeep.  Patrick is inside.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I don&#39;t know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the 
                    flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
          
                                 JOEY
                    Enough with the Barbie n&#39; Ken shit. I 
                    know.
          
          He pulls out his wallet and hands Patrick a wad of money
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    Take it
          
          Patrick does, with a smile, as he ROARS out of the parking 
          lot.

          Kat and Mandella deface a prom flyer.
          
                                 KAT
                    Can you even imagine?  Who the hell 
                    would go to this a bastion of commercial 
                    excess?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Well, I guess we&#39;re not, since we don&#39;t 
                    have dates .
          
                                 KAT
                    Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, 
                    all pissed off because Archie is taking 
                    Veronica.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                    Okay, okay, we won&#39;t go.  It&#39;s not like 
                    I have a dress anyway
          
                                 KAT
                    You &#39; re looking at this from the wrong 
                    perspective.  We&#39;re making a statement.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (unconvinced)
                    Oh, good.  Something new and different 
                    for us.

          Mr. Chapin patrols as boys and girls shoot arrows at targets
          
          Joey swaggers up to Bianca, who is taking careful aim. 
          Chastity watches from across the row.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Hey, sweet cheeks.

                           (not looking at 
                           him)
                    Hi, Joey.
          
                                 JOEY
                    You&#39;re concentrating awfully hard 
                    considering it&#39;s gym class.
          
          She lets the arrow go and turns to look at him.
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    Listen, I want to talk to you about the 
                    prom.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You know the deal.  I can &#39; t go if Kat 
                    doesn&#39;t go --
          
          In the background, a RASTA crumples to the ground.  Hit
          A casualty of Gym.  Mr. Chapin scurries over.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Your sister is going.
          
          Bianca looks at him, surprised
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Since when?
          
          Joey takes the bow and arrow from Bianca&#39;s hand.  He draws 
          back and takes aim.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    I&#39;m taking care of it.
          
          Chastity looks over from her spot on the field, but keeps 
          lips firmly shut.

          Patrick appears, through a hole in the books.

                    Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine 
                    Mystique?  I lost my copy.

                                 PATRICK
                    I heard there was a poetry reading.
          
                                 KAT
                    You &#39;re so --

                    Pleasant?
          
          Kat stares at him, deadpan.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Wholesome.

                    Unwelcome.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has 
                    her panties in a twist.
          
                                 KAT
                    Don&#39;t for one minute think that you had 
                    any effect whatsoever on my panties.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So what did I have an effect on ?
          
                                 KAT
                    Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
          
          She pushes past him and heads out the&#39; door
          Pat looks down at the book he&#39;s been holding in his hand:  
          Taming of the Shrew.

                    You were right. She&#39;s still pissed.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Sweet love, renew thy force!

                    Man -- don&#39;t say shit like that to  me. 
                    People can hear you.

                           (exasperated)
                    You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice  
                    yourself on the altar of dignity and  
                    even the score.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Best case scenario, you&#39;re back on the 
                    payroll for awhile.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What&#39;s the worst?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You get the girl.
          
          Patrick  thinks for a minute
          
                                 PATRICK
                    If I go down. I&#39;m takin&#39; her with me

          Patrick&#39;s seat is conspicuously empty.
          
          From outside, we hear the soft, unsure beginnings of a SONG. 
          Kat looks up, then out the window, HORRIFIED.
          
          The song grows louder until we realize it&#39;s The Partridge 
          Family&#39;s &quot;I Think I Love You&quot;.  Being sung by Patrick.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (0. S.)
                    &quot;This morning, I woke up with this 
                    feeling, I didn&#39;t know how to deal with, 
                    and so I just decided to myself--&quot;
          
          The STUDENTS rush to the window. OUTSIDE Patrick stands 
          beneath the window, crooning.
          
          Scurvy is next to him, keeping the beat on the bongos and 
          doing backup vocal s.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    &quot;I&#39;d hide it to myself.  And never talk 
                    about it.  And didn&#39;t I go and shout it 
                    when you walked into the room --&quot;
          
          He makes quite a sarcastic show of it.
          
          IN THE CLASSROOM
          
          Mrs. Blaise touches her heart, as if the song is for her. 
          Kat slowly walks to the window, peeking below.
          
          OUTSIDE
          
          Patrick smiles at her as he finishes the verse with a big 
          finale.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    &quot; I think I love you I &quot;
          
          INSIDE
          
          The other students laugh, clap, cheer, etc. Kat sinks down, 
          mortified, but with a slight smile
          
          INT. DETENTION HALL - DAY
          
          Patrick and several other miscreants sit quietly, mulling 
          over their misfortune.
          
                                 MISCREANT 
                    Nice song, Verona.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Flog me.
          
          He makes the appropriate hand gesture
          
          Mr. Chapin, the gym teacher, sits at the desk in front, 
          ignoring them while he reads a girly weightlifting magazine
          
                                 KAT (0. S.)
                    Excuse me, Mr. Chapin?
          
          Patrick looks up at the sound of her voice and sees Kat 
          standing in the doorway.  She gives him a smile and he perks 
          up a little.
          
          Kat walks into the room and addresses Mr. Chapin again. He 
          turns fully to face her.
          
                                 KAT
                    Sir, I&#39;d like to state for the record 
                    that Mr. Verona &#39; s current 
                    incarceration is unnecessary.  I never 
                    filed a complaint.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    You didn&#39;t have to.  He disrupted a 
                    classroom.
          
          Kat glances over at Patrick and motions her head toward the 
          window.
          
          Patrick shrugs, not knowing what she &#39; s talking about.
          
          She motions again, and looks toward the window with an 
          expression that says, &quot;Make a break for it, moron.&quot;
          
          Kat brings her attention back to Mr. Chapin while Patrick 
          inches out of his seat toward the window.
          
          The other miscreants watch with glee.
          
                                 KAT
                    But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a 
                    simple serenade warrants a week of 
                    detention.  There are far more hideous 
                    acts than off-key singing being 
                    performed by the student body on a 
                    regular basis.
          
          Patrick is halfway out the window now.  And none too happy 
          about it, considering they&#39;re on the second floor.
          
          He eyes a large TREE a few feet away from MR. CHAPIN.  He 
          starts to turn away from Kat
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    You&#39;re not gonna change my mind, Kat. 
                    Rules stick.
          
          Kat starts to panic, as Patrick has yet to make the jump for 
          the tree.
          
                                 KAT
                    Wait, Mr. Chapin.  There&#39;s something 
                    I&#39;ve always wanted to show you.
          
          He turns back toward her again, the very second before he 
          would have spotted Patrick.
          
          Kat glances toward the window.  Patrick&#39;s just about to make 
          the jump.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    What?
          
                                 KAT
                    These.
          
          From behind, we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra 
          at Mr. Chapin, just as Patrick makes the Jump.
          
          The miscreants cheer, for both the daring&#39; escape and the 
          flash of skin.
          
          Mr. Chapin reddens and tries to be stern.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    I&#39;m going to let that slide, Katarina.  
                    But if I catch you doing that again, 
                    you&#39;ll be in here with the rest of these 
                    guys.
          
          He motions to the remaining detention prisoners, without 
          noticing Patrick&#39;s absence.
          
          Kat smiles at him.
          
                                 KAT
                    Thank you, Mr. Chapin.
          
          Kat bolts out the door.  Mr. Chapin goes back to his muscle 
          mag, wiping the sweat from his brow.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL CAMPUS LAWN
          
          Kat arrives at the tree. looking around breathlessly, seeing 
          no one.
          
                                 KAT
                    He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he 
                    cruised on me.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (0. S.)
                    Look up, sunshine
          
          She does.  He&#39;s still in the tree
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I guess I never told you I&#39;m afraid of 
                    heights.
          
                                 KAT
                           (smiling)
                    C&#39;mon.  It&#39;s not that bad
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Try lookin&#39; at it from this angle
          
          She assesses the branch structure
          
                                 KAT
                    Put your right foot there --
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Forget it.  I&#39;m stayin&#39;.
          
                                 KAT
                    You want me to climb up and show you 
                    how to get down?
          
                                 PATRICK
                           (voice trembling)
                    Maybe.
          
          She sighs and dose so.  When she gets to his level, she 
          perches on the branch next to him.  He grins at her.
          
          Then swings himself down with the grace and ease of a 
          monkey, leaving her sitting there, realizing she&#39;s been 
          duped.
          
                                 KAT
                    You shit!
          
          She climbs down after him
          
          EXT. OUTDOOR ARCADE - DAY 
          
          Patrick and Kat walk amongst the games
          
                                 KAT
                    The Partridge Family?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I figured it had to be something 
                    ridiculous to win your respect.  And 
                    piss you off.
          
                                 KAT
                    Good call.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So how&#39;d you get Chapin to look the 
                    other way?
          
                                 KAT
                    I dazzled him with my wit
          
          She stops and picks up a toy gun that SHOOTS water at 
          giggling hyenas and wails on it.  The barker hands her a 
          stuffed animal as her prize.  She hands it to the small KID 
          next to her and they continue walking.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (sarcastic)
                    A soft side? Who knew?
          
                                 KAT
                    Yeah, well, don&#39;t let it get out
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So what&#39;s your excuse?
          
                                 KAT
                    Acting the way we do.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yes
          
                                 KAT
                    I don&#39;t like to do what people expect.  
                    Then they expect it all the time and 
                    they get disappointed when you change.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So if you disappoint them from the 
                    start, you&#39;re covered?
          
                                 KAT
                    Something like that
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Then you screwed up
          
                                 KAT
                    How?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You never disappointed me.
          
          She blushes under his gaze
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    You up for it?
          
                                 KAT
                    For. . . ?
          
          He motions to the SIGN for a paint-ball game. She grins 
          SERIES OF SHOTS:
          
          The two of them creep through the paint-ball course, 
          stealthy and full of the desire to best the other.
          
          Patrick nails Kat in the back with a big glob of red paint 
          Kat gets him in the chest with a glob of blue.
          
          Patrick returns fire with a big yellow splat to the side of 
          her face.
          
          Kat squirts a green shot to his forehead After a few more 
          shots, they&#39;re both covered in paint
          
          She tries to shoot him again, only to find that her gun is 
          empty.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Damn it!
          
          Patrick grabs her in a victorious tackle.  They land, 
          laughing.
          
          It&#39;s hard to even recognize them, as their hair and faces 
          are so smeared with paint globs, but they still manage to 
          find each other&#39;s eyes.
          
          He wipes a smear of blue paint away from her lips,  as he 
          goes to kiss her.

          His mother hurries him away. What&#39;s started as a tackle has 
          turned into a passionate kiss
          
          EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Patrick pulls up in Kat&#39;s driveway.  Their paint wardrobe 
          has dried by now and they look like refugees from some 
          strange, yet colorful, war.
          
                                 KAT
                    State trooper?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Fallacy.
          
                                 KAT
                    The duck?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Hearsay.
          
                                 KAT
                    I know the porn career&#39;s a lie.
          
          He shuts off the car and turns to her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Do you?
          
          He kisses her neck.  It tickles.  She laughs.
          
                                 KAT
                    Tell me something true.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I hate peas.
          
                                 KAT
                    No -- something real.  Something no one 
                    else knows.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (in-between kisses)
                    You&#39;re sweet.  And sexy.  And 
                    completely hot for me.
          
                                 KAT
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No one else knows
          
                                 KAT
                    You&#39;re amazingly self-assured. Has 
                    anyone ever told you that?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Go to the prom with me
          
          Kat&#39;s smile disappears.
          
                                 KAT
                    Is that a request or a command?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You know what I mean
          
                                 KAT
                    No.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No what?
          
                                 KAT
                    No, I won&#39;t go with you
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Why not?
          
                                 KAT
                    Because I don&#39;t want to. It&#39;s a stupid 
                    tradition.
          
          Patrick sits quietly, torn. He can&#39;t very well tell her he 
          being paid to take her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    People won&#39;t expect you to go...
          
          Kat turns to him, getting angry.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why are you doing this?
          
                                 KAT
                    All of it -- what&#39;s in it for you?
          
          He sits silently, not looking at her, confirming her 
          suspicions.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Create a little drama?  Start a new 
                    rumor?  What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So I have to have a motive to be with 
                    you?
          
                                 KAT
                    You tell me.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told 
                    you that?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (quietly)
                    Answer the question, Patrick
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (angry)
                    Nothing!  There&#39;s nothing in it for me.  
                    Just the pleasure of your company.
          
          He takes out a cigarette.  She breaks it in half before she 
          SLAMS the car door and walks into the house.
          
          Patrick PEELS out of the driveway. Kat turns at the front 
          door and watches him go
          
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
          
          Patrick pulls up to a stop light and waits for .the green
          
          He glances over at A DRUNKEN HOMELESS GUY in the median, who 
          has decided that he doesn&#39;t need to wear pants.
          
          Patrick pulls out his wallet, takes the wad of money Joey 
          gave him and hands it to the homeless guy.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    cover that up
          
          The light turns green and Patrick pulls away
          
          INT. STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kat stands at the sink, scrubbing paint off of her face 
          Bianca TAPS on the open door.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Quick question -- are you going to the 
                    prom?
          
          Kat pushes the door shut with a SLAM
          
          INT. STUDY HALL - DAY
          
          Cameron and Bianca sit together at their study cubby.  She 
          fingers a strand of her hair.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Then Guillermo says, &quot;If you go any 
                    lighter, you&#39;re gonna look like an extra 
                    on 90210.&quot;
          
                                 CAMERON
                    No...
          
          Bianca stares at him for a moment.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    do you listen to this crap?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    What crap?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I&#39;m 
                    like, boring myself.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Thank God!  If I had to hear one more 
                    story about your coiffure...
          
          He mock stabs himself with a pencil as she giggles and 
          smacks his hand away.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    I figured you&#39;d get to the good stuff 
                    eventually.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    What good stuff?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    The &quot;real you&quot;.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Like my fear of wearing pastels?
          
          He looks stricken.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    I&#39;m kidding. 
                           (beat)
                    You know how sometimes you just become 
                    this &quot;persona&quot;?  And you don&#39;t know how 
                    to quit?
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (matter of fact)
                    No
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Okay -- you&#39;re gonna need to learn how 
                    to lie.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Mandella struggles with the lock on her locker.  Finally, it 
          opens.
          
          Hanging inside is a beautiful DRESS, inspired by the 16th 
          Century.  Mandella slowly unpins a NOTE from the dress.
          
          INSERT - &quot;0 FAIR ONE.  JOIN ME AT THE PROM.  I WILL BE 
          WAITING.  LOVE, WILLIAM S.&quot;
          
          Mandella&#39;s agog.  Trevor walks by and sees her holding the 
          dress.
          
                                 TREVOR
                    You&#39;re gonna look splendiferous in 
                    that, Mandella.
          
          Mandella looks up sharply, shaken from her reverie.
          
                                 TREVOR 
                           (continuing)
                    that&#39;s cool to say.
          
          Mandella grins It is

          Sharon is at her computer, Walter at his exercise bike
          
                                 SHARON
                    Would you rather be ravished by a 
                    pirate or a British rear admiral?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Pirate -- no question.
          
          Bianca enters and walks over to Walter
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with 
                    you. It&#39;s tomorrow night --
          
                                 WALTER
                    The prom?  Kat has a date?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No, but
          
                                 WALTER
                    It&#39;s that hot rod Joey, right? That &#39; s 
                    who you want me to bend my rules for?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    He&#39;s not a &quot;hot rod&quot;.  Whatever that 
                    is.
          
                                 WALTER
                    You&#39;re not going unless your sister 
                    goes.  End of story.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Fine.  I see that I&#39;m a prisoner in my 
                    own house.  I&#39;m not a daughter. I&#39;m a 
                    possession!
          
          Bianca storms out.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (calling out)
                    You know what happens at proms?
          
          Sharon stops her typing and looks up at Walter
          
                                 SHARON
                    They&#39;ll dance, they&#39;ll kiss, they&#39;ll 
                    come home.  Let her go.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Kissing?  Is that what you think 
                    happens?  Kissing isn&#39;t what keeps me up 
                    to my elbows in placenta all day.
          
          INT. BIANCA&#39;S ROOM - NIGHT 
          
          Bianca lies on her bed.  MTV blares.  A KNOCK sounds.
          
          BIANCA
          Come in.
          
          Kat enters and sits down on the bed, muting the TV.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (kindly)
                    Listen, I know you hate having to sit 
                    home because I&#39;m not Susie High School.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Like you care.
          
                                 KAT
                    I do care. But I&#39;m a firm believer in 
                    doing something for your own reasons, 
                    not someone else &#39; s .
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I wish I had that luxury. I&#39;m the only 
                    sophomore that got asked to the prom and 
                    I can&#39;t go, because you won &#39; t.
          
          Kat clears her throat
          
                                 KAT
                    Joey never told you we went out, did 
                    he?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    What?
          
                                 KAT
                    In 9th.  For a month
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (confused)
                    Why?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (self-mocking)
                    He was, like, a total babe
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But you hate Joey
          
                                 KAT
                    Now I do.  Back then, was a different 
                    story.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    As in...
          
          Kat takes a deep breath.
          
                                 KAT
                    He said everyone was doing it.  So I 
                    did it.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You did what?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing on)
                    Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I 
                    didn&#39;t want to anymore.  I wasn&#39;t ready.  
                    He got pissed.  Then he broke up with 
                    me.
          
          Bianca stares at her, dumbfounded
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But
          
                                 KAT
                    After that, I swore I&#39;d never do 
                    anything just because &quot;everyone else&quot; 
                    was doing it.  And I haven&#39;t since. 
                    Except for Bogey&#39;s party, and my 
                    stunning gastro-intestinal display --
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (stunned)
                    Why didn&#39;t you tell me?
          
                                 KAT
                    I wanted to let you make up your own 
                    mind about him.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No. you didn&#39;t!  If you really thought 
                    I could make my own decisions, you 
                    would&#39;ve let me go out with him instead 
                    of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
          
          Kat stands up slowly
          
                                 KAT
                    That&#39;s not
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I&#39;m not stupid enough to repeat your 
                    mistakes.
          
                                 KAT
                    I guess I thought I was protecting you.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    God, you&#39;re just like him! Just keep me 
                    locked away in the dark, so I can&#39;t 
                    experience anything for myself
          
                                 KAT
                    Not all experiences are good, Bianca. 
                    You can&#39;t always trust the people you 
                    want to.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I guess I&#39;ll never know, will I?
          
          She rises and holds the door open for Kat, then slams it 
          behind her.
          
          EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY 
          
          A sprinkler cruises the lawn.
          
          INT. KAT&#39;S ROOM - DAY
          
          Kat lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.  She rolls over and 
          picks up the phone.
          
          BIANCA&#39;S ROOM - DAY
          
          Bianca, still in her pajamas, eats a bowl of cereal while 
          watching &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; reruns.
          
          A KNOCK sounds
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Come in.
          
          Kat opens the door and peers in with a grin
          
                                 KAT
                    Feel like shopping?
          
          Bianca looks up, hopefully.
          
          LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Walter and Sharon are in front of the television.  Walter 
          has the TV Guide in hand, glasses on.
          
                                 WALTER
                    What do you wanna watch?  We&#39;ve got 
                    crap, crap, crap or crap
          
                                 SHARON 
                    Dr. Ruth?
          
          Bianca walks into the living room.  She&#39;s wearing a prom 
          dress.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Hi, Mommy.
                           (looking away)
                                 WALTER
          
          Walter scurries takes off his glasses and looks from Bianca 
          to Sharon.
          
                                 SHARON 
                    Honey, you look beautiful!
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You like?  My date should be here in 
                    five.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I&#39;m missing something.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I have a date, Daddy.  And he &#39; s not a 
                    captain of oppression like some men we 
                    know.
          
          The DOORBELL RINGS.  Bianca runs to open it.  There stands 
          CAMERON.  He takes in Bianca&#39;s outfit.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Wow
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Let&#39;s go.
          
          Walter rises.  Sharon pulls him back down on the couch
          
                                 SHARON 
                           (to Bianca)
                    Have a great time, honey!
          
                                 WALTER
                    But -- who -- what --?
          
          The door SLAMS.  As Sharon looks at Walter with a grin, a 
          blur rushes down the stairs and out the door.  The blur has 
          Kat &#39; s voice.
          
                                 KAT
                    Hey, guys. I&#39;m going to the prom. See 
                    you in a few.
          
          The door SLAMS again.  Walter and Sharon &#39;are alone
          
                                 WALTER
                    What just happened?
          
                                 SHARON
                    Your daughters went to the prom.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Did I have anything to say about it?
          
                                 SHARON 
                    Absolutely not.
          
                                 WALTER
                    That &#39; s what I thought
          
          The DOORBELL RINGS again. Walter opens it to find Joey on 
          the porch, wearing a tux.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    I&#39;m here to pick up Bianca.
          
                                 WALTER
                    late
          
          He SLAMS the door shut
          
          EXT  HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
          
          Kat pulls up in her car, emerging resplendent in an ice 
          gown.
          
          Patrick sits on the steps, waiting.  In a tux.
          
                                 KAT
                    How&#39;d you get a tux at the last minute?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It&#39;s Scurvy&#39;s.  His date got convicted.  
                    Where&#39;d you get the dress?
          
                                 KAT
                    It&#39;s just something I had.  You know
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (smiling)
                    Oh huh
          
                                 KAT
                    Look, I&#39;m  -- sorry -- that I 
                    questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
          
          Patrick winces slightly, but covers it with a smile
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No prob.
          
          He remains seated.  Kat fidgets nervously.
          
                                 KAT
                    are you ready?
          
          He rises and stares at her, taking in her image 
          appreciatively.  She blushes and turns away.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    C&#39;mon.  Let&#39;s get this over with.
          
          INT.  PROM - NIGHT
          
          A hotel ballroom transformed into a fantasy world.  Patrick 
          and Kat enter, Kat attempting to deny the romance of it.
          
                                 KAT
                    Quite the ostentatious display
          
          A cowboy two-steps by them, dragging some poor girl around
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Look, Clem even wore his good boots
          
          Kat steps forward, looking around and spots Cameron and 
          Bianca dancing cheek to cheek.  She smiles.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Mandella enters nervously, in the long Elizabethan gown, 
          hair piled on top of her head.  She spots Kat and hurries 
          over.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Have you seen him?
          
                                 KAT
                    Who?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    William - he asked me to meet him here.
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, honey -- tell me we haven&#39;t&#39; 
                    progressed to full-on hallucinations.
          
          Patrick looks toward the door and taps Kat.  She turns and 
          points Mandella the same way.
          
          Michael - in full Shakespearean dress with a new goatee on 
          his chin - bows in their direction. Mandella&#39;s grin couldn&#39;t 
          be bigger.
          
          Michael swashbuckles over to them, taking Mandella&#39;s hand 
          and leading her onto the dance floor.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Mi&#39; lady.
          
                           (to Patrick)
                    Good sir.
          
          Patrick rolls his eyes.
          
          INT.  PROM - NIGHT - LATER
          
          Kat and Patrick dance to a slow SONG.  Whatever he&#39;s 
          whispering into her ear is making her laugh.
          
          Cam and Bianca dance nearby, glowing with happiness. She 
          whispers something in his ear and heads for the ladies&#39; room
          
          INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bianca walks in, positively radiant. Chastity emerges from a 
          stall.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (surprised)
                    What are you doing here?
          
          Chastity checks her hair in the mirror,  aloof.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    You think you &#39; re the only sophomore 
                    at the prom?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I did.
          
          Chastity maintains her snooty tone.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    And just so you know, my date isn&#39;t 
                    planning on spending most of the night 
                    in his backseat.
          
          BIANCA What&#39;re you talking about?
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Joey Dorsey is only after one thing - - 
                    your cherry. He practically made a 
                    public announcement.
          
          Appalled, Bianca storms out. Chastity  tries to backpedal.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                           (continuing)
                    I wanted to tell you
          
          INT.  PROM - NIGHT
          
          Joey, drunk, disorderly and pissed off, walks in with a few 
          stray jocks - also dateless.  He zeroes in on Cameron, now 
          consoling a pissed-off Bianca.
          
          Patrick and Kat continue to slow dance, oblivious to the 
          evil about to erupt.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    My grandmother&#39;s .
          
                                 KAT
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    That&#39;s where I was last year.  She&#39;d 
                    never lived alone -- my grandfather died 
                    -- I stayed with her.  I wasn&#39;t in jail, 
                    I don&#39;t know Marilyn Manson, and I&#39;ve 
                    never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent 
                    a year sitting next to my grandma on the 
                    couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of 
                    story.
          
          He takes a breath and looks away, not meeting her eyes. Kat 
          stares at him for a moment and laughs a delighted laugh
          
                                 KAT
                    That &#39; s completely adorable!
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It gets worse -- you still have your 
                    freshman yearbook?
          
          He&#39;s interrupted by Joey&#39;s hand on his shoulder.
          
                                 JOEY
                    What&#39;s Bianca doing here with that 
                    cheese dick?  I didn&#39;t pay you to let 
                    some little punk ass snake me.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Michael spots the altercation and dances Mandella over to 
          Cameron and Bianca.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (to Cameron)
                    Feces hitting fan.  C&#39;mon
          
          Michael takes Cameron aside, leaving Mandella and Bianca 
          staring after them.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Michael and Cameron approach Joey as he continues to taunt 
          Patrick who keeps quiet, realizing the weight of this 
          situation.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (continuing)
                    Joey, pal, compadre.  Let&#39;s take it 
                    easy.
          
          Joey turns toward Michael and Cameron.
          
          JOEY You two are in big trouble
          
          Cameron faces Joey.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Admit it.  You lost.  Be a man.
          
          Joey PUNCHES Cameron in the face, taking him by surprise 
          Cameron holds his nose as it bleeds onto his tux
          
          The various cliques descend angrily and Joey is soon 
          surrounded by seething Cowboys, Coffee Kids and White 
          Rastas.
          
                                 DEREK 
                    Very uncool, my brother
          
                                 JOEY
                    I&#39;m not your brother, white boy.
          
          The other Rastas GASP, as if stung by the realization that 
          they&#39;re white.
          
          Joey turns back to Patrick and Kat.
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    Just so you know -- she&#39;ll only spread 
                    her legs once.
          
          Kat looks from Joey to Patrick, not sure what she&#39;s hearing. 
          Joey pushes through the crowd but a HAND drags him back. 
          It&#39;s Bianca.  And she BELTS the hell out of him
          
                                 BIANCA
                    That&#39;s for making my date bleed
          
          She BELTS him again
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    That&#39;s for my sister.
          
          And AGAIN
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    And that&#39;s for me.
          
          Cliques now descend on Joey, punching him wildly.
          
                                 COWBOY
                    And that&#39;s for the fourth grade, 
                    asshole.
          
          HOTEL - NIGHT 
          
          KAT runs down the stairs, Patrick chasing her
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Wait I...
          
                                 KAT
                    You were paid to take me out!  By -- 
                    the one person I truly hate.  I knew it 
                    was a set-up!
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It wasn&#39;t like that.
          
                                 KAT
                    Really?  What was it like?  A down 
                    payment now, then a bonus for sleeping 
                    with me?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I didn&#39;t care about the money.
          
          He catches up to her now
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    I cared about --
          
          She turns to face him with a countenance more in sorrow than 
          in anger.
          
                                 KAT
                    You are so not what I thought you were.
          
          He grabs her and kisses her to shut her up.  After a second, 
          she jerks away and flees down the stairs and out of sight.
          
          Bianca stands at the top of the stairs, watching.  She&#39;s 
          never looked more guilty.
          
          INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY
          
          Kat is sprawled on the couch in sweats, wrapped in a 
          blanket, watching &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;.  When Molly Ringwald 
          leans across the birthday cake to get a kiss from her dream 
          date, Kat changes the channel disgustedly, settling for an 
          infomercial
          
          The phone sits next to her.  Not ringing.  Bianca breezes 
          in, bearing a cup of tea.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Are you sure you don&#39;t want to come 
                    with us?  It&#39;ll be fun.
          
          Kat takes the tea and gives a weak smile.
          
                                 KAT
                    I &#39; m sure .
          
          Bianca sits down next to her
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You looked beautiful last night, you 
                    know.
          
                                 KAT
                    So did you
          
          Bianca gives her a squeeze, then jumps up when the DOORBELL 
          rings, opening the door to a waiting Cameron.  He peeks his 
          head inside.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    She okay?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I hope so.
          
          The door shuts behind her as Walter enters.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Was that your sister?
          
                                 KAT
                    Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big 
                    ones.  Full of sperm.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Funny.
          
          Walter sits down on the arm of the chair and watches the 
          infomercial with Kat.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    I don&#39;t understand the allure of 
                    dehydrated food.  Is this something I 
                    should be hip to?
          
                                 KAT
                    No, Daddy.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (dreading the 
                           answer)
                    So tell me about this dance. Was it 
                    fun?
          
                                 KAT
                    Parts of it.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Which parts?
          
                                 KAT
                    The part where Bianca beat the hell out 
                    of some guy.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Bianca did what?
          
                                 KAT
                    What&#39;s the matter?  Upset that I rubbed 
                    off on her?
          
                                 WALTER
                    No -- impressed.
          
          Kat looks up in surprise.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    You know, fathers don&#39;t like to admit 
                    that their daughters are capable of 
                    running their own lives.  It means we&#39;ve 
                    become spectators.  Bianca still lets me 
                    play a few innings.  You&#39;ve had me on 
                    the bleachers for years.  When you go to 
                    Sarah Lawrence, I won&#39;t even be able to 
                    watch the game.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (hopeful)
                    When I go?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Oh, Christ.  Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve 
                    changed your mind.  I already sent &#39;em a 
                    check.
          
          Kat reaches over and gives him a hug
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY Kat stands grabs a box of cornflakes 
          from the food line.
          
                                 CAMERON (0. S.)
                    Katarina?
          
          She turns and looks at him
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I&#39;d like to express my apologies.
          
                                 KAT
                    For what?
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (looking down)
                    I didn&#39;t mean for you to get -- When 
                    Bianca asked me to find you a boyfriend, 
                    I had no idea it would turn out so -- 
                    ugly. I would never have  done anything 
                    to compromise your - - -
          
          He trails off when he realizes she&#39;s thrown her food tray 
          against the wall and marched off -- the old &quot;kill, kill&quot; 
          look back in her eyes.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
          
          Kat stomps up the hallway, full of menace
          
          CLASSROOM - DAY
          
          Bianca&#39;s English teacher perches on the edge of a desk, open 
          book in hand.
          
                                 TEACHER
                    Who can tell me at what point Lucentio 
                    admits his deception?
          
          The door of the classroom FLIES open and an angry Kat stalks 
          in, yanking Bianca from her chair and dragging her toward 
          the hallway.
          
                                 KAT

          Bianca tries to pull away as Kat drags her by the hair 
          between two rows of lockers.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Let go!
          
                                 KAT
                    You set me up.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I just wanted --
          
                                 KAT
                    What? To completely damage me?  To send 
                    me to therapy forever? What?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No! I just wanted
          
          Miss Perky walks up
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Ladies?  Shall we take a trip to my 
                    office?
          
          INT. MISS PERKY&#39;S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Miss Perky stares at both sisters as they sit before her, 
          then focuses on Bianca.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    So you&#39;re the real bitch
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Yes!  Okay?  Yes -- I&#39;m the real bitch.  
                    I wanted her to get a boyfriend so I 
                    could.  Apparently, this makes me a 
                    horrible person.  I&#39;m sorry.
          
          She turns to Kat.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    I swear -- I didn&#39;t know about the 
                    money.  I didn&#39;t even know Joey was 
                    involved.  I would never intentionally 
                    hurt you, Kat.
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                           (to Kat)
                    Do you care to respond?
          
                                 KAT
                    Am I supposed to feel better? Like, 
                    right now?  Or do I have some time to 
                    think about it?
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                    Just smack her now.
          
          Bianca rises, taking Kat by the arm.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (to Miss Perky)

                    Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or 
                    is it just me?
          
                                 KAT
                    It&#39;s just you.
          
          ENGLISH CLASS - DAY 
          
          Mrs. Blaise faces the class
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    All right.  I&#39;m assuming everyone found 
                    time to compose, their poems. Except for 
                    Mr. Dorsey, who&#39;s still in ICU.
          
          Nerds in the back high-five each other.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    Would anyone care to read theirs aloud?
          
          No one moves.  Then Kat slowly stands up.
          
                                 KAT
                    I&#39;11 go
          
          Patrick looks up.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                    Oh, Lord.
          
          She downs a couple Prozac
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    Please proceed.
          
          Kat stands, puts on her glasses, and takes a deep breath 
          before reading from her notebook.
          
                                 KAT
                    I hate the way you talk to me/ and the 
                    way you cut your hair/ I hate the way 
                    you drive my car/ I hate it when you 
                    stare.
          
          She pauses, then continues
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    I hate your big dumb combat boots/ and 
                    the way you read my mind/ I hate you so 
                    much it makes me sick/ it even makes me 
                    rhyme.
          
          She takes a deep breath, and looks quickly at Patrick, who 
          stares at the floor.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    I hate the way you&#39;re always right/ I 
                    hate it when you lie/ I hate it when you 
                    make me laugh/ even worse when you make 
                    me cry/ I hate it that you&#39;re not 
                    around/ and the fact that you didn&#39;t 
                    call/ But mostly I hate the way I don &#39; 
                    t hate you/ not even close, not even a 
                    little bit, not even any at all.
          
          She looks directly at Patrick.  He looks back this time.  
          The look they exchange says everything.
          
          Then she walks out of the room The rest of the class remains 
          in stunned silence.
          
          EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Kat walks to her car alone. When she opens the door, she&#39;s 
          greeted with a Fender Stratocaster guitar, reclining in the 
          front seat.
          
          She picks it up slowly, inspecting every detail, then spins 
          around.
          
          Patrick stands there, smiling.
          
                                 KAT
                    A Fender Strat. You bought this?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I thought you could use it. When you 
                    start your band.
          
          She doesn&#39;t answer, but hides a smile, so he walks  closer.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Besides, I had some extra cash. Some 
                    asshole paid me to take out a really 
                    great girl.
          
                                 KAT
                    Is that right?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for 
                    her.
          
          Blushes and looks down.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    You know -- it&#39;s not every day you find 
                    a girl who&#39;ll flash her tits to get you 
                    out of detention.
          
          Looks up. surprised and embarrassed that he found out
          
          He takes her upturned face as a sign to kiss her and he does 
          She lets him this time.
          
          Then breaks it off
          
                                 KAT
                    You can&#39;t just buy me a guitar every 
                    time you screw up, you know.
          
          He grimaces.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I know
          
          He quiets her with another kiss Which she breaks off again.
          
                                 KAT
                    And don&#39;t just think you can
          
          He kisses her again, not letting her end it this time.
          
          STRATFORD HOUSE - SUNSET
          
          We hear the sounds of MUSIC and LAUGHTER.
          
          STRATFORD HOUSE/BACKYARD - SUNSET
          
          Patrick is at the barbecue grill, flipping burgers.  Kat 
          watches.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why is my veggie burger the only burnt 
                    object on this grill?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Because I like to torture you.
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman 
                    yearbook?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Don &#39; t you even dare. . .
          
          ON BIANCA AND CAMERON As they argue on the patio.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    They do to!
          
                                 BIANCA
                    They do not!
          
          Rises to get the yearbook.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Can someone please tell her that 
                    sunflower seeds come from sunflowers?
          
          ON MICHAEL AND MANDELLA
          
          Severely making-out in a lawn chair.  She comes up for a 
          breath.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    I can&#39;t remember a word of Shakespeare 
                    right now. Isn&#39;t that weird?
          
          Michael pulls her back down for another round ON KAT AND 
          PATRICK
          
          She tries to keep him from grabbing the yearbook that Bianca 
          now hands her.
          
                                 KAT
                    You&#39;re freaked over this, aren&#39;t you?
          
          Bianca hands her the yearbook
          
                                 BIANCA
                    He&#39;s more than freaked.  He&#39;s froke
          
          Flips to a page.
          
                                 KAT
                    I&#39;d like to call your attention to 
                    Patrick Verona&#39;s stunning bad-ass look 
                    of 1995 ---
          
          INSERT - A horrifically nerdy freshman year picture Glasses, 
          bad hair, headgear -- the works.
          
          She holds up the picture for all to view. Patrick cringes 
          and throws a handful of pretzels at her.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Patrick -- is that- a.
          
                                 KAT
                    Perm?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Ask my attorney.
          
          Kat and Bianca huddle over the picture, giggling --  as we 
          CRANE UP and hear a GIRLY PUNK version of The Partridge 
          Family&#39;s &quot;I Think I Love You&quot;.
          
          FADE OUT:
          
          END

&lt;pre&gt;
	FADE IN

	on the words CZECH AIRLINE.  We are panning across the words
	on the side of the plane.

	INT. AIRPLANE

	ANGLE DOWN

	on a tray table.  Crumpled Czech bills and coins are on it. 
	Hands are counting the money.  The airline hostess announces
	the arrival at JFK - in CZECH.  A hand reaches into a breast
	pocket - pulling out two passports.  One is opened.  Belongs
	to EMIL SLOVAK.  The next passport belongs to OLEG RAZGUL. 
	The hand passes the Oleg Razgul passport to the man next to
	him.  We notice several empty airline bottles of vodka and a
	small disposable camera on Oleg&#39;s tray table.  The passport
	is set down.  Oleg picks it up.  We hear Emil&#39;s voice in
	CZECH.  The scene is subtitled in ENGLISH.

				EMIL (V.O.)
		Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I
		say.  Don&#39;t open your mouth.

				OLEG (V.O.)
		Okay.

	INT. PASSPORT CONTROL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY

	CAMERA DOLLIES down a long line of passengers.  They are
	split into two lines - one for Americans, the other for
	visitors.  CAMERA finally arrives at EMIL SLOVAK.  An
	unshaven Czech in his mid-30&#39;s.  Tall, scraggly beard. 
	Piercing blue eyes.  He&#39;s dressed in an outdated suit.  His
	eyes are alert, cunning and smart.

	OLEG RAZGUL, stands in line behind Emil.  Oleg is big.  Not
	tall - but wide.  A wrestler&#39;s body.  Emil looks at Oleg. 
	(The following is in CZECH and subtitled in ENGLISH.)

				EMIL
		Don&#39;t fool around.

				OLEG
		Okay.

	Oleg holds up his disposable camera - at arms length - to
	take a picture of himself.

				EMIL
		Did you hear what I said?

				OLEG
		I want to document my trip to America.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Next.
			(Emil steps up)
		Could I see your documents, please?

				EMIL
		Yes sir.

	He hands the passport to the officer who runs it through an
	image swipe.  Emil glances furtively back to Oleg.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		What is your intended purpose of your
		visit to the United States?

				EMIL
		Two weeks holiday.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		How much money are you carrying with
		you?

				EMIL
		I have five-hundred dollars.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the
		FIS area!

	Oleg was about to take a picture of Emil and the Immigration
	Officer.  Oleg puts the camera away.  Smiles sheepishly.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER (CONT&#39;D)
			(to Emil)
		Is he with you?  Are you travelling
		together?

				EMIL
		Yes.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Please join us.
			(to Oleg)
		Come on forward.

				EMIL
		Is there a problem?

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		No, you&#39;re travelling together.  I want
		to talk to you together.  Hi, how are
		you?  Can I take a look at your
		documents?
			(takes Oleg&#39;s passport)
		Are you related?

				OLEG
		Yes...he&#39;s my friend.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Okay.  You&#39;re a Czech national and
		you&#39;re a Russian national.  How do you
		know one another?

	Oleg starts to speak, but Emil cuts him off.

				EMIL
		We are both from Prague.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
			(to Oleg)
		How long are you planning to stay?

				EMIL
		Two weeks.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		I&#39;d like to speak for himself, okay?

				EMIL
		He doesn&#39;t speak English.

				OLEG
		I speak English.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
			(to Oleg)
		Then answer my questions.  Where were
		you planning to stay during the two
		weeks that you&#39;re here?

				OLEG
		New York.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Yes, we&#39;re in New York now.  But where
		are you planning to stay in New York?

				OLEG
		A cheap hotel.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		What are you coming here to do?

				OLEG
		I&#39;m here for movies.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Movies...to be in the movies or to see
		movies?

				OLEG
		Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I
		see movie at school called &quot;It&#39;s a
		Wonderful Life&quot; directed by Frank Capra. 
		Ever since I want to come to America. 
		Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A
		land where anyone can be anything. As
		long as they are white.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Excuse me?

				EMIL
		He made joke, bad joke.  First time on
		airplane...

	The SUPERVISOR comes over to see what the problem is:

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Well, they&#39;ve got valid visas, but they
		don&#39;t have much money.  Uh... and I&#39;m
		not...uh, I think there&#39;s a possibility
		they may be coming to live and reside.

				SUPERVISOR
		Look how long the line is.  We gotta
		move &#39;em out.  I&#39;ll take them down to
		secondary.

	Emil looks at Oleg, pissed.

	INT. P.B. HERMAN&#39;S RESTAURANT - DAY

	The place is empty except for one table at the end of the
	bar.  EDDIE FLEMMING, Manhattan&#39;s most famous detective, and
	his savvy, black partner, LEON JACKSON are having cocktails. 
	Eddie is smoothly handsome, tough, smart and tired.  Not only
	is he the best homicide detective Manhattan has ever seen,
	he&#39;s continually mentioned in New York columns and has been
	the subject of several magazine articles.  There&#39;s even been
	a TV movie about one of his biggest cases.  Leon has been
	with Eddie a long time and was also featured in the TV movie.

	Sitting with Eddie and Leon is ROBERT HAWKINS, host and star
	reporter for the tabloid show, &quot;Top Story.&quot;  Hawkins is also
	the best in the business and has dealt with them all: Joey
	Buttafuco and Amy Fisher, Lorena Bobbit and OJ.

	Wait staff bustles in the b.g. doing the morning set up. 
	Hawkins listens as Eddie, cigar in hand, finishes a &quot;war
	story&quot; and a vodka tonic at the same time.

				EDDIE
		So we&#39;re waitin&#39; to hit this warrant -
		we got Emergency Service with the heavy
		weapons standin&#39; by - ready to go.  I
		say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I
		go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the
		sudden I turn around and a kid with a
		shotgun let one go.  Right where I was
		standin&#39;.  That coulda been it.  I
		coulda had my head blown off and for
		what?  Some stupid kid got panicky,
		takes the safety off and it&#39;s over.  If
		I hadn&#39;t gone back for that cigar - for
		a bad habit - I would&#39;ve had my head
		blown off.

				HAWKINS
		Jesus Christ.

	PAULIE, the owner, walks up.

				PAULIE
		Speakin&#39; of bad habits, everybody okay?

				HAWKINS
		Another martini.

				LEON
		Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.

				EDDIE
		Vodka tonic.

				LEON
			(rethinks it)
		Maybe you could just put in a shot of
		Martell?

	Paulie takes the drinks off the table and an empty bottle of
	vodka.

				LEON (CONT&#39;D)
			(of Eddie&#39;s story)
		It was freaky, I&#39;ll tell you.  Stupid
		kid.

				EDDIE
		What&#39;s the kid gonna say - sorry? 
		Meanwhile I&#39;m not here anymore. 
		Like last week - we were at the morgue
		and this guy was all chopped up - spleen
		here - liver there - his heart in a pan. 
		Six hours ago this guy was walkin&#39; his
		dog or buyin&#39; a quart of milk.  Who
		knows?  But some kid&#39;s robbed him for $3
		or some shit and shot him and now you
		can&#39;t tell if he&#39;s a piece of beef or a
		human being and I&#39;m thinkin&#39; that&#39;s me. 
		Sooner or later.  That&#39;s me.  

				HAWKINS
		Sooner or later that&#39;s everybody.  

				EDDIE
		Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like
		that.  I mean, what do I got left? 
		Coupla articles.  A medal or two. 
		Plaque here and there and in a coupla
		years no one remembers me anymore.

				HAWKINS
		I think you&#39;re getting a little moody
		there, Eddie.

				EDDIE
		I&#39;m not moody.

	Hawkins and Leon share a look.

				HAWKINS
		Isn&#39;t he a little moody?

				LEON
		Of course he&#39;s moody.  He thinks he&#39;s in
		love.

				HAWKINS
		In love?  With who?

	Paulie delivers the drinks and sets some cigars on the table. 
	Takes a seat next to Eddie.  Eddie asks Hawkins.

				EDDIE
		How old are your kids?

				HAWKINS
		My kids?  Let&#39;s see...Susan&#39;s 15. 
		Aundrea&#39;s 9.  Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re
		thinking about having a kid!  How old
		are you?  Never mind. 
		Let me just tell you this: Every stupid
		cliche you hear about kids - they change
		your life, they make you a better
		person, they make you whole...
			(beat)
		It&#39;s all true!  Before I had kids when
		friends talked about their kids, I
		wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I
		right, Leon?

				LEON
		Absomotherfuckin&#39;lutely.  You can have
		all three of my ex-wives.  But somebody
		so much as looks sideways at my four
		girls -- I&#39;d kill &#39;em.  
			(takes out his wallet)
		You haven&#39;t seen my youngest have you?

	As he hands pictures to Hawkins his cell phone rings.

				LEON (CONT&#39;D)
		Yeah?

				HAWKINS
		Paulie, you&#39;ve got kids, right?

				PAULIE
		My kids don&#39;t talk to me anymore but
		they were great when they were young.

				LEON
			(into the phone)
		Sure it&#39;s him?  Great!
			(collapses the phone)
		Unique&#39;s home.

	They all rise from the table.

				EDDIE
		Paulie, I need the cure.

				PAULIE
		Step into my office.

	Leon and Hawkins sit back down as Eddie and Paulie leave.

				HAWKINS
		So you got your kids listening to Opera? 
		You still singing in the church on the
		weekends?

	INT. SECONDARY IMMIGRATION OFFICE - DAY

	Now other officers are questioning Emil and Oleg.  They&#39;ve
	been there a while.  The SECONDARY OFFICER is looking Oleg.

				SECONDARY OFFICER
		Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I
		understand that.
			(to Emil)
		And what kind of work do you do?

				EMIL
		I am butcher.

				SECONDARY OFFICER
		You&#39;re a butcher?  What do you use pig
		intestines for?

				EMIL
		You stuff sausage in it.

				SECONDARY OFFICER
		And what do you do with the bones?

				EMIL
		Dog food.

	Emil looks at Oleg.  Blaming his stupid responses at Passport
	Control for their detainment.

				SECONDARY OFFICER
		Are you married?

				EMIL
		No.  Are you proposing?

	ANGLE UP

	through a thousand ICE CUBES.  A face plunges towards us...

	INT. MENS ROOM

	Eddie has his back to us as he dunks his face into a sink
	full of ice.  He dries his face, looks into his bloodshot
	eyes.  Presents a small black ring box to the mirror.

				EDDIE
		Will you marry me?  Wanna get married? 
		What are you doin&#39; Saturday?

	Leon enters.  Eddie turns.

				EDDIE (CONT&#39;D)
		I&#39;m gonna propose.

				LEON
		When?

				EDDIE
		Tomorrow.  At lunch.

				LEON
		You ready?

	Eddie leans back and drops some Visine in his eyes.  Turns.

				EDDIE
		The thrill of the hunt.  I love it.

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY

	Oleg and Emil stare at the bright lights - all the nonstop
	action.  Each stands with an old suitcase.

				OLEG
			(in Russian)
		Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the
		movies!

				EMIL
			(in Czech)
		Don&#39;t speak Russian!

				OLEG
			(in Russian)
		Why?  Why do I always have to speak to
		you in Czech?

				EMIL
			(in Czech)
		Because I don&#39;t like your ugly language. 
		I heard enough of it in school!  Now
		speak Czech or English.  And don&#39;t fool
		around anymore.  You almost got us
		thrown out!

	Emil pulls out an envelope with Milos&#39; address on it.  This
	is who they came to see.  Emil hails a CAB.  Oleg is staring
	inside a camera store - at himself on a monitor.  A
	videocamera&#39;s pointed out in the street.

				OLEG
		Look.  New videocameras.  Color
		viewfinder.  Image stabilization. 
		Solarization.  Night vision.

				EMIL
		We have no money.  Come on.

	Oleg stares at the videocamera - dying to have one like this. 
	Emil slides into the cab.

				CABBIE
		Where you wanna go, buddy?

	Emil pulls out the post-marked envelope.  Points to the
	return address on it and passes it through the slot to the
	Cabbie.

				EMIL
		Here.

	Emil looks out the window - no sign of Oleg.  Then, Oleg
	hurries out the camera store, gripping something inside his
	coat.  He flings both suitcases in the trunk, SLAMS it shut 
	and jumps in the back seat.  He opens his jacket - pulling
	out the VIDEOCAMERA he just stole.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		Go!

	Oleg smiles sheepishly at Emil.
		

	EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - DAY

	Eddie&#39;s car pulls up.  Eddie, Leon and Hawkins get out.

				HAWKINS
		So what&#39;s unique?

				EDDIE
		Not what.  Who.

	Eddie passes Hawkins a Polaroid - of a woman on a bed -
	covered in blood.

				EDDIE (CONT&#39;D)
		He&#39;s from Antigua.  His girlfriend was
		taking too long to put her make-up on. 
		they were late for a party.  Stabbed her
		with a beer bottle.

				HAWKINS
		That&#39;s unique.

				EDDIE
		Yeah.  And he still went to the party.

	Leon moves to a LOOKOUT - gives him a twenty.

				LOOKOUT
		Top floor.  Back room.

				EDDIE
		Yeah.  I make big cases, they make the
		news and I look good.  But the problem
		with becoming a star is downtown.  They
		shoot at stars.  Now be quiet.  Shhh.

	As they reach the doorway - Eddie surprises two crackheads. 
	Waves them off.  They hurry away.

				EDDIE (CONT&#39;D)
		I hope this prick doesn&#39;t run.  My knees
		are killing me.  Stay behind me.

				HAWKINS
		You&#39;re worried for my safety.  I&#39;m
		touched.

	Eddie flattens against the building - watches Unique descend
	the fire escape.

				HAWKINS (CONT&#39;D)
		Ready?

				EDDIE
		Keep them out of my way.

				HAWKINS
		Okay.  You ready?

				EDDIE
		Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.

	Eddie closes in.

				HAWKINS
			(into his cell phone)
		COME ON!  COME ON!  YOU FUCKING GUYS,
		LET&#39;S MOVE IT!

	Unique is climbing down the fire escape - before he gets to
	the bottom, Leon bursts through a door behind him and kicks
	the fire escape, sending Unique flying into the alley.  Where
	he lands dropping his gun.

	Eddie pulls him off the ground as Leon scoops the gun up.

				EDDIE
		What&#39;s your rush?  Going to a party?

				UNIQUE
		Why you chasin&#39; me, man?

				EDDIE
		I don&#39;t know.  You always come outta
		your house that way?

				UNIQUE
		It&#39;s not my house, man.  I don&#39;t live
		here.

				EDDIE
		Well, sounds like burglary to me.

	Leon cuffs Unique who recognizes Eddie.

				UNIQUE
		I know you man.

	An unmarked van comes tearing into the scene.  Disgorges a
	mini-cam team that starts filming but they missed the bust.

				HAWKINS
			(to Eddie)
		Any chance we can do that again?

				EDDIE
		Again?  I didn&#39;t wanna do it the first
		time.
						

	EXT. EAST SIDE - LATE DAY

	The cab is in front of an old five-story brownstone.  Oleg
	gets the bags out of the trunk as Emil tucks the envelope
	into his jacket, then steps up to the old building.  He looks
	back at Oleg - who&#39;s VIDEOTAPING him.

				EMIL
		Turn that off!  Get the bags.

				OLEG
		Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a
		dog.

				EMIL
		For five years I paid for your
		stupidness - you&#39;ll carry my bag for the
		rest of my life if I say so.
			(challenging)
		Unless you refuse, Oleg.

	Oleg looks at Emil.  Even though Oleg is stronger than Emil,
	he fears him.  He picks up both bags.  Emil searches the
	occupant list over the buzzers to the apartment building.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		There.  5RW.

	Emil pushes ten of the buzzers except 5RW.  A BUZZER clicks
	and Emil pushes it open.

	INT. MILOS&#39; APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DAY

	The brownstone has no elevator so Emil and Oleg climb the
	stairs... Oleg cradling his camera.  Emil notices a crack
	pipe on the floor and picks it up.  Smells the bowl.

				OLEG
		What?

				EMIL
		Smell like chemicals...for smoking
		drugs.

	Emil pockets the pipe and climbs to the top floor, moving
	down the dirty hallway to a corner door.

	INT. MILOS&#39; APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

	He KNOCKS...FOOTSTEPS approach.  The door is opened by MILOS -
	a 40-year-old Czech, dressed in stained plumbers overalls. 
	He  is surprised to see Emil and Oleg in his doorway.  Oleg
	films him...

				MILOS
		Emil???!

				EMIL
		Surprise!  Surprise!

	Milos shoots a look across the tiny kitchen to TAMINA, his
	comely wife.

	INT. MILOS&#39; APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	Emil pushes his way inside.  Oleg follows.  Milos wears
	plumbers overalls but Emil notices sports a Rolex.  Tamina
	has on a faded dress but despite their cheaply furnished
	apartment she wears an expensive brushed gold necklace,
	bracelet and big pearl earrings.  The room is furnished with
	kitsch from Disney World and Las Vegas.  The only anomaly is
	a HUGE SONY TRINITRON HOME ENTERTAINMENT CENTER.  (The
	following is in Czech and subtitled in English.)

				EMIL
		Your sister said she didn&#39;t know where
		you were so you shouldn&#39;t write to her
		with return address if you&#39;re hiding. 

				MILOS
		Did you hurt her?

				EMIL
		You know me...I never hurt anybody. 
		Where&#39;s the money?

				OLEG
		Hello, Tamina.

	Oleg is looking Tamina over.  Milos - though scared - barks
	at Oleg.

				MILOS
		Take your eyes off her, Oleg!
			(to Emil)
		Look.  It wasn&#39;t my fault you two were
		caught.
			(of Oleg)
		It&#39;s his fault.  Trying to get the bank
		clerk&#39;s phone number?!  I wasn&#39;t going
		to wait!!!

				EMIL
		Milos.  Get my money!

	Oleg videotapes the scene.

	CLOSE ON AN AJAR DOOR

	All we see behind it is a WOMAN&#39;S FACE and her wet hair - she
	obviously came from the shower and we see the towel wrapped
	around her.

				MILOS
			(nervously)
		We spent it!

				EMIL
		Ha. Ha.

				MILOS
		Look at the way we live.  I&#39;m a plumber. 
		You think I&#39;d be working if I had
		money?!

	Emil, pissed, moves to a wood block and pulls out a KITCHEN
	KNIFE.  He grabs Tamina roughly, putting the blade to her
	throat.

				MILOS (CONT&#39;D)
		Emil.  Put down the knife.

	Milos looks at his wife - who is terrified.

				MILOS (CONT&#39;D)
		Emil.  I&#39;ll help you.

	Milos closes the gap between him and Emil - trying to calm
	him by talking softly.

				MILOS (CONT&#39;D)
		I can get you a job.

				EMIL
		A job?

				MILOS
		Yes, the money is good.

				EMIL
		As a plumber?!

				MILOS
		It&#39;s easy to learn.

				EMIL
		A job??  As a plumber???  You think I
		come to America to work!

				MILOS
		We started over, you can too.

				EMIL
			(furious)
		You spent all the money while I was in
		prison?  Now you tell me to get a job
		fixing toilets?!?

	Emil pulls the knife away from Tamina - then angrily PLUNGES
	it toward Milos&#39; chest!

	Oleg videotapes it.  Then lowers the camera - shocked that
	Emil killed Milos.

	Blood sprays Tamina&#39;s face.  She tries to run but Oleg grabs
	her, not noticing her brushed gold bracelet falls to the
	floor.  He covers her mouth as he points the videocamera at
	Emil who STABS Tamina - absolutely enraged!

	THE WOMAN BEHIND THE DOOR

	flees...Emil hears NOISE in the bedroom - a window opening. 
	Emil kicks the bedroom door open.  Sees the window leading to
	the fire escape.  He dashes to it.  Sees four flights down -
	the WOMAN, wearing a summer dress.  Barefoot.  Her hair still
	wet.  

	She looks up.  She is beautiful and terrified.  She runs
	down the alley.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		She saw!

	Emil hurries toward the bathroom.  She just got out of the
	shower.  Her underwear and purse are draped over a chair. 
	Emil grabs the purse.  Finds a CZECHOSLOVAKIAN PASSPORT.  He
	opens the cover, stares at her photo and name.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		Daphne Hanlova.

	There&#39;s one stamp in the passport - from the U.S. when she
	arrived - June 16, 1998.  Underneath is written - 6 MONTH
	STAY.  Emil flips through the rest of the passport - all
	blank pages.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		Six month visa.  Still here two years
		later.  They&#39;ll deport her if she goes
		to Police.

	Emil pockets Daphne&#39;s passport and wallet, scoops up her
	shoes and jacket - enters the kitchen and dumps them on the
	floor.  He tears through the kitchen cabinets, throwing cans
	and bottles aside.

				OLEG
		What are you looking for?

	Emil finds nail polish remover - looks at the bodies.

				EMIL
		I&#39;m going to make a bohemian barbecue.

	Emil draws the kitchen curtains plunging the room into
	darkness.
		
		EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

	A face comes from the darkness.  It&#39;s an athletically
	handsome man, jogging out of a tunnel towards us.  He&#39;s in a
	tie and jacket in Central Park at NIGHT. 
	He is JORDAN (JORDY) WARSAW.  A sensitive man of rugged
	honesty.  He runs down the hill in a hurry.  A MUGGER steps
	in his path.

				MUGGER
		Got any spare change?  How &#39;bout a spare
		twenty?

				JORDY
		Look, I don&#39;t have time for you, get out
		of my way!!

				MUGGER
		Alright, how &#39;bout all your fuckin&#39;
		money?

	The Mugger pulls a knife - and in a whirl of movement, Jordy
	grabs his wrist and disarms him in a deadly, professional
	manner - hurling him down to the pavement, twisting his arm
	behind his back.  With his other hand, Jordy whips out a
	BROWNING 9MM from his shoulder holster and places it behind
	the mugger&#39;s head.  Jordy displays his shield.

				JORDY
		Okay, you&#39;re under arrest!  Now you
		happy?

				MUGGER
		Fire Department?  Firemen don&#39;t carry
		guns.

				JORDY
		Oh yeah?  Guess again.

	Jordy handcuffs the Mugger and searches the Mugger&#39;s coat
	pockets - pulling out a handful of driver&#39;s licenses and
	credit cards.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		Nice - how many people you ripped off
		tonight?!  Get up!

	As Jordy yanks the Mugger to his feet, his BEEPER goes off.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		You couldn&#39;t listen to me, could you?

	Jordy drags the Mugger to a tree.  Cuffs him so his face is
	pressed up against the bark.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		I&#39;ll send a cop back for you.

				MUGGER
		Hey.  C&#39;mon, you can&#39;t leave me like
		this.  Some freak&#39;ll come by and stab
		me!

	Jordy jogs off across the park.

				MUGGER (CONT&#39;D)
		Wait!  Come back!!

	EXT. MILOS&#39; APARTMENT - NIGHT

	FIRE TRUCKS from three battalions.  Radios CRACKLE.  There&#39;s
	a crowd growing.  Jordy pushes his way through.  The top
	floor of the brownstone where Milos and Tamina lived has been
	reduced to smoking ruins.  The trees are covered in debris
	and soot.  Jordy moves to LOUIE - Battalion Chief.

				LOUIE
		Lieutenant - take up your line and
		relieve Ladder Company 60 on the top
		floor.

				JORDY
		Hey, Louie, were you first due?

				LOUIE
		Yeah, I radioed you guys right away
		&#39;cause you got two roasts on the top
		floor but you don&#39;t hafta investigate
		cause homicide is up there.

				JORDY
		Homicide?  Who let them up?  I didn&#39;t
		make it a crime scene yet.

				LOUIE
		Hey, it&#39;s Eddie Flemming.

				KORFIN (O.S.)
		Yo, Jordy!

	BOBBY KORFIN - an overweight arson investigator with a quick
	with and good sense of humor - comes over, pulling on a
	turnout coat.

				KORFIN (CONT&#39;D)
		Where you been, man?  We got a
		celebrity!

				JORDY
		I heard.  Who the hell let them up
		there?

				KORFIN
		I don&#39;t know, you think Eddie will give
		me his autograph?

				JORDY
		You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody
		suspicious?

				KORFIN
		Naw - I&#39;m sure the suspect&#39;s not here.

				JORDY
		Oh yeah, why?

				KORFIN
		&#39;Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by
		now!

	INT. MILOS&#39; APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The roof is gone.  The sky is exposed.  It&#39;s charred ruins,
	smoked beams and watery muck.  Eddie and Leon are standing by
	what&#39;s left of the mattress, looking at Milos and Tamina&#39;s
	charred bodies.  Eddie grips a half-smoked Cuban cigar,
	listening to Leon.

				LEON
		So, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine
		position - that they were doin&#39; each
		other but were so whacked out of their
		heads they set the pipe on the mattress,
		lit it up, and they got fried.  What do
		you think, Eddie?

	Jordy enters - with Korfin who&#39;s carrying a paint can.

				EDDIE
		I don&#39;t know.  We got the experts here. 
		Show them what you found - I hope you
		don&#39;t mind, we came over to see if we
		could help.

	Korfin makes a beeline for Eddie - wanting to meet the
	celebrity.

				KORFIN
		Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming -
		Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with
		you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.

				JORDY
		Could you put out the cigar?  Part of
		the job is picking up scents.

				EDDIE
		Oh, sure.

	Eddie puts his cigar out.  Carefully slides it into a cigar
	holder and pockets it to finish later.

				LEON
		Well, I found - check it out - crack
		pipe.  Looks like they got careless.

	Leon displays the pipe Emil found on the stairs.  Korfin
	shines the flashlight on Leon to look at the pipe.

				LEON (CONT&#39;D)
		Mind not shining that light in my eyes?

				KORFIN
		Sorry, bro.

				JORDY
		Hey, that&#39;s great you guys got it all
		wrapped up, but you don&#39;t mind if we go
		through the routine?  It gives us
		somethin&#39; to do.

				EDDIE
		No, we don&#39;t mind.  You mind Leon?

				LEON
		No.  Go ahead.

				JORDY
		Thanks.  Appreciate it.

	Jordy throws a look at Korfin.  Homicide detectives have no
	respect for fire marshals&#39; investigative skills.  Eddie
	rummages through the apartment - moving into the kitchen and
	living room... Leon watches as Korfin sticks a pencil in a
	charred beam, measuring how deep in it goes.

				KORFIN
		Okay, Jordy - it was a fast fire, we got
		good patterns - about thirty minutes
		old.

	Jordy moves to one of the corpses.  He pulls on a white
	rubber glove.  Inserts his finger in the corpses mouth.  The
	glove comes out white.

				JORDY
		Mouth&#39;s clean, too.

				KORFIN
		Clean?

				JORDY
		Don&#39;t blow your nose!

	Jordy&#39;s looking at Leon, who was just about to blow his nose.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		The smoke&#39;ll permeate your nostrils -
		burn &#39;em out.  Let it run.

				KORFIN
		But you knew that, right?

	Leon looks at Jordy, then lowers the handkerchief.  Jordy
	turns back to the corpses on the bed.  Eddie - in the other
	room - has found Tamina&#39;s brushed gold bracelet on the floor.

				JORDY
		So the way you see it, two crack heads
		burned themselves up?

				LEON
		That&#39;s what it looks like to me.

				JORDY
		And while they&#39;re burning up, they&#39;re
		still goin&#39; down on each other?  You got
		to hand it to them.

				LEON
			(realizes he&#39;s wrong - blows it
			 off)
		Yeah, well, some people got their
		priorities straight.

	Leon watches Jordy, quietly.  With a pair of tweezers, Jordy
	pulls a small unburned piece of cloth from behind one of the
	heads.  Korfin supplies the paint can.  Jordy drops the cloth
	inside.

				LEON (CONT&#39;D)
		What was that?

				JORDY
		Evidence.  Of a homicide.

	That got Eddie&#39;s attention and he comes back to the bedroom.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		You know what that is, right?

				EDDIE
		No, what is it?

				JORDY
		Why don&#39;t you explain it, Bobby.
			(to a fireman joking a wall)
		Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole
		in the floor?

				CAMELLO
		No problem.
			(to Eddie and Leon)
		Excuse me, gentlemen.  You might wanna
		back up a little more.  Don&#39;t wanna get
		your pants wet.

	Leon and Eddie move to higher ground - on top of a burnt TV
	set.  Eddie hands the brushed bracelet to Leon.  As Camello
	hacks at the floor with an ax, Jordy continues to examine the
	bodies and Korfin explains:

				KORFIN
		They have not soot in their mouths,
		which means they weren&#39;t breathin&#39;
		before the fire and that usually means
		they were deceased - and this piece of
		cloth that my partner found means they
		were wrapped up in something, probably
		doused with a flammable liquid and
		positioned like this on the bed.  To the
		untrained eye, it looks like an
		accident.

	Jordy kicks around the draining floor, reaches down for
	something.

				LEON
		What&#39;s he looking for?

				EDDIE
		A timer.

	Jordy finds some wires attached to an outlet, pulls them up -
	on the other end is a timer.  Korfin takes the timer from
	Jordy and moves to Eddie.

				KORFIN
		Here you go.  A big double homicide.

	EXT. MILOS&#39; APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	As Jordy and Korfin exit the brownstone, a CAMERA CREW is
	arriving.  Jumps out. 
	Korfin and Jordy cross toward Korfin&#39;s car.  They open the
	trunk.  Take off their muddy boots throwing them in.

				KORFIN
		You see Eddie&#39;s face when I gave him the
		timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.

				JORDY
		He knew all along.

				KORFIN
		What??

				JORDY
		That&#39;s why he was so quiet.  He was
		testing us.

	Eddie and Leon exit - Eddie carrying a baggie with a timer
	inside.  NICOLETTE KARAS, young and attractive, pushes her
	microphone at Eddie.  She&#39;s smart, aggressive and respected
	by her peers.

				NICOLETTE
		Detective, does it look like a murder?

				EDDIE
		We don&#39;t know that yet.  It&#39;s much too
		early.  There&#39;s a lot to be done.

				NICOLETTE
		How many victims are up there?

				EDDIE
		There are two bodies found at this
		point.

				NICOLETTE
		Can we go up to the crime scene?

				EDDIE
		You know you can&#39;t do that.  C&#39;mon.

				NICOLETTE
		Is it drug related?

				EDDIE
		We don&#39;t know.  When I have more I&#39;ll
		let you know.

	Nicolette signals for her camera man, MIKE, to zoom in on
	Eddie&#39;s hand.  She barrels on...

				NICOLETTE
		Detective...what&#39;s that you&#39;re holding
		in your hand?  Evidence?

	Mike pans up to Eddie&#39;s face.  Other reporters arrive,
	hurling questions which Eddie easily answers.  Cameras flash
	as we PAN BACK TO Korfin and Jordy.  Jordy is about to get in
	the car as he notices, back behind some construction - DAPHNE
	HANDLOVA.  She&#39;s still wearing the crumpled summer dress. 
	She tentatively steps out to signal Jordy.  He only catches a
	glimpse of her.  He starts toward her -- knifes through the
	crowd - but Daphne is gone.

				KORFIN
		What?

				JORDY
		There was a woman - I think she wanted
		to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh
		shit!  Oh no!

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER

	Korfin&#39;s car SCREECHES to a stop.  Jordy leaps out. 
	Suddenly, Jordy stops...the Mugger handcuffed to the tree is
	now NAKED!

				MUGGER
		You motherfuckin&#39; bastard!  She stripped
		me!  It was a bag lady!  She touched me
		all over, it was disgusting.

	Jordy unlocks the handcuffs.

				JORDY
		I&#39;m sorry.  I&#39;m really sorry.

	Korfin delivers a blanket.  Jordy covers him.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		You okay?

				MUGGER
		A dog pissed on me!!  I&#39;m gonna sue you
		for this!  You violated my civil rights!

				JORDY
		Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob
		me!  I could arrest you right now! 
		You&#39;re lucky you&#39;re walking away from
		this.  Now get outta here.

	Jordy gives him a push.  The Mugger wraps the blanket around
	himself cursing - hurrying away.
		

	EXT. 8TH AVENUE - NIGHT

	Exhausted HOOKERS who have worked all night loiter outside a
	sleazy hotel.  CAMERA PANS up to a blinking hotel sign.

	INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	The light is blinking an eerie green and yellow light into
	the room.  Emil is at the window pulling the blind down
	trying to shut out the blinking light.  He pulls it down
	twice and it pops back up both times.  The third time he
	angrily pulls it so hard, it comes off the window completely. 
	He sits down in a chair in frustration - adjusting a pillow
	behind his back.  THE ROSEANNE SHOW is on TV.  Roseanne has
	been talking to a FATHER.

				ROSEANNE (ON T.V.)
		So you slept with your son&#39;s wife! 
		What&#39;s that all about?

				FATHER (ON T.V.)
		I take full responsibility for sleepin&#39;
		with my daughter in law.  I had low self
		esteem, I thought I had to compete with
		him.

	Emil reaches for his dictionary.

				EMIL
			(mutters)
		Self-esteem?  Self-esteem??

	He flips through his dictionary to find the meaning of self
	esteem.

				FATHER (ON T.V.)
		Losin&#39; my job and everything, caused my
		behavioral disorder.
			(turns to his son)
		Forgive me, Kirk.  Let me hug you?

	The audience boos.  Roseanne mediates...

	Oleg - fresh from the shower with wet hair - sits on the bed
	in his skivvies - staring into the videocamera&#39;s LCD screen -
	rewinding Milos&#39; murder.  We see it now for the first time -
	as he rewinds it.  Oleg watches - a bottle of cheap vodka
	between his legs.  Emil, looks up from his dictionary.  He&#39;s
	wearing Milos&#39; Rolex. 
	Tamina&#39;s jewelry - her brushed gold necklace and pearl
	earrings - are in front of him with Daphne&#39;s wallet.  Emil
	looks up - Oleg is holding his videocamera.

				EMIL
			(Czech)
		Turn that fucking thing off!

				OLEG
			(Czech)
		I&#39;m not filming.  I&#39;m watching Milos
		die.  It&#39;s just like a move but realer.

	Emil grabs the videocamera.
			(Czech)
		Don&#39;t break it!  Don&#39;t break it!

				EMIL
		Speak English!

				OLEG
			(English)
		You said speak Czech!

				EMIL
		How you erase this?

				OLEG
		I&#39;ll do it.  Don&#39;t hurt my camera!

	Emil tosses the camera back to Oleg who drops his vodka
	bottle in order to catch the camera.  Oleg, holding the
	camera like it&#39;s gold, goes to the dresser and puts it away. 
	Emil starts to go through Daphne&#39;s wallet.

				EMIL
		Stupid, Milos.  I didn&#39;t want to kill
		him.
			(noticing)
		What&#39;s this?

	Emil found the last card in the wallet.  It&#39;s pink with a
	picture of a busty globe.  Printed in the middle is - WORLDLY
	ESCORTS - and a number.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		Worldly escorts?

	Emil picks up his dictionary and begins to flip the pages -
	finding the meaning of worldly.  He gets up and dials the
	number.  A soft, SEXY VOICE answers.  Soft music in the
	background.

				SEXY VOICE
		Hi?

				EMIL
		Hello?

				SEXY VOICE
		Are you looking for companionship?

	Oleg, who&#39;s listening, moves to Emil.

				OLEG
		Whore?

				EMIL
		I&#39;m homesick.  You have Eastern European
		girl?  A Czech girl?

				SEXY VOICE
		Matter of fact, I have a lovely Czech
		girl.

				EMIL
		I take her.  Send her!

	EXT. FIRE STATION 91 - NIGHT

	Korfin&#39;s car pulls up to the station - as a fire engine is
	returning.

				JORDY
		Now that you know him, maybe you can get
		extra work in the next movie they make
		about him.

				KORFIN
		Yeah?

				JORDY
		Maybe you can be his stand-in.

	INT. FIRE STATION 91 - NIGHT

	The men are pulling off their equipment - coming down from
	the high of fighting a fire.  Korfin and Jordy walk toward
	the TV room.  The TV is on in the background.  We can see
	Nicolette interviewing Eddie.  He holds up the paint can.

				CHIEF DUFFY (O.S.)
		What the hell is that??  You gave Eddie
		Flemming the evidence?!

	They turn.  DEPUTY CHIEF FIRE MARSHAL DECLAN DUFFY - the head
	of the arson squad - comes over.  Duffy&#39;s tough, Irish and
	very political.

				DUFFY
			(pointing to the TV)
		Who did cause and origin?

				JORDY
		Who do you think, Chief?!

				DUFFY
		Then why didn&#39;t you talk to the
		reporter?

				JORDY
		&#39;Cause we got more important things to
		do, like finding out who did it.

	They walk to the back of the station and start up the stairs.

				DUFFY
		Don&#39;t you guys understand?  It&#39;s all
		about image.  The better we look the
		more money I get to pay you guys
		overtime.

				KORFIN
		Yeah, right.

				DUFFY
		What was that, Korfin?

				KORFIN
		I said, yeah, you&#39;re right, Chief.  As
		soon as we get somethin&#39; we&#39;ll let you
		alert the media.

				DUFFY
		You do that, wiseguy.  Now let&#39;s solve
		this thing before Eddie Flemming does.

	They all head upstairs.

	INT. ARSON SQUAD ROOM - DAY

	The Chief, Jordy and Korfin enter.  There are posters of
	pyros, arsonists and terrorists on the walls.  GARCIA - a
	Puerto Rican investigator - looks up from his desk.

				GARCIA
		Hey guys, I got your torch.  He just
		gave a full confession.

	A scruffy, unshaven white man sitting across from Garcia,
	turns.  He is MAX, a pyromaniac in his 40&#39;s with a freshly
	scratched cross etched in his forehead.  He craves attention.

				MAX
		It&#39;s my fire!  Screw homicide.  I&#39;ll
		tell you guys everything!

	Jordy moves to his desk with Korfin.  They sit across from
	each other.  Duffy keeps going to his office, not even
	bothering to stop.

				JORDY
		What&#39;s that on your forehead, Max? 
		That&#39;s a nice attention getter.

				MAX
		Yeah, I&#39;m religious.  I&#39;m not an Atheist
		like you!  Now, are you guys gonna
		arrest me, or not?

				JORDY
		How did you start the fire this time?

				MAX
		I used an accelerant.

				JORDY
		Yeah?  What kind?

				MAX
			(to Jordy)
		Hey, by the way, I&#39;m really sorry about
		your wife leavin&#39; you.

				KORFIN
		Max.

				MAX
			(continuing)
		...Yeah, and with your old man dying
		last year you - what&#39;s it?  Just you and
		the dog now?

				KORFIN
		Max!  

				MAX
		Does it feel bad - I mean the new guy
		your ex-wife&#39;s seeing - I hear he&#39;s a
		big shot downtown.

	Jordy pops out of his seat.

				JORDY
		That&#39;s it!  You&#39;re outta here.

	Jordy pulls Max by the collar - pushes him down the aisle.

				MAX
		That&#39;s it.  I&#39;m suing.

				KORFIN
		Get in line.

	Korfin takes over - throwing him out.  Jordy turns to Garcia
	who is laughing.

				JORDY
		What&#39;s so funny.  How does he know so
		much about me?  Who tells him my life
		story?

				GARCIA
		He hangs around downstairs.  The guys
		talk to him.  He&#39;s a joke...

				JORDY
		He&#39;s no joke!  One day he&#39;s gonna
		graduate from trash can fires and do
		something big.

				GARCIA
		Okay.  Okay.  We&#39;ll ban him from the
		station.

	INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - TV SET - NIGHT

	As the &quot;Top Story&quot; logo is splashed across the screen,
	accompanied by a catchy TV THEME, Robert Hawkins introduces
	America&#39;s highest rated &#39;news magazine&#39; show.

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		Good evening, I&#39;m Robert Hawkins and
		this is Top Story.  Tonight we bring you
		an exclusive interview with Stephen
		Geller - who horrified the nation two
		years ago when he went berserk and
		murdered three clerks in a Manhattan
		shoe store.  But now, Mr. Geller&#39;s
		claim, spoken softly and articulately,
		is that he is the victim.  According to
		Mr. Geller, the events of that fateful
		day were not his fault but were the
		fault of his psychiatrist.  Hard to
		believe...watch.

				EMIL (O.S.)
		Louder.

	VIDEOCAMERA SLOWLY ZOOMS OUT and PANS over to Emil, sitting
	on the hotel bed watching the TV.  He looks at us.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		Louder.

	Oleg&#39;s hand reaches in front of the lens - turning up the
	volume.  The scene cuts back to Stephen Geller being
	interviewed by Robert Hawkins and his camera crew.  He&#39;s
	sitting on the front lawn of a mental institution in a paint
	stained shirt.  A showing of his artwork is displayed in the
	background.  Patients peruse the paintings of weird
	dysfunctional faces that avoid eye contact.  One of the
	paintings depicts Eddie Flemming and Leon Jackson.

				STEPHEN GELLER
		This had nothing to do with shoes that
		didn&#39;t fit or my relationship with my
		father who, as you know, made a fortune
		selling penny loafers in the fifties. 
		These people died because of the
		criminal actions of my doctor.

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		Your doctor?

				STEPHEN GELLER
		Yes.  My psychiatrist didn&#39;t insist that
		I stay on my medication.

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		...so you feel absolutely no
		responsibility for killing these people?

				STEPHEN GELLER
		It was my finger that pulled the
		trigger, but I&#39;m not morally
		responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what
		I was capable of.  How could I know. 
		I&#39;m not a doctor.

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		You seem very savvy for a man who&#39;s been
		found mentally incompetent to stand
		trial.

				STEPHEN GELLER
		Look, I&#39;m a victim here, too.  I was a
		year away from getting my masters in
		Art, now I&#39;ll never graduate.  My life
		has been permanently disrupted.

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		Permanently disrupted?  Aren&#39;t you
		selling paintings now for quite a lot of
		money?  Hasn&#39;t this &#39;incident&#39; as you
		call it, jump started your career as an
		artist?

				STEPHEN GELLER
		Look, I&#39;m in here.  You call this a
		career move?

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		And isn&#39;t there a movie in the works
		about you?

				STEPHEN GELLER
		We&#39;re in negotiations, that&#39;s correct.

				ROBERT HAWKINS
		But doesn&#39;t the Son of Sam Law prevent
		criminals from profiting from their
		crimes?

				STEPHEN GELLER
		That doesn&#39;t apply to me because I&#39;m not
		a criminal.  I&#39;m not a criminal!  I
		wasn&#39;t convicted.

	Emil leans forward - listening.  Fascinated.

				EMIL
		I love America.  No one is responsible
		for what they do.

	There&#39;s a KNOCK on the door.  Our VIDEOCAMERA POV swings over
	to it.  Then WHIPS back to Emil.  Emil looks at us.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		Get in the bathroom!

				OLEG (O.S.)
		Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?

				EMIL
		Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and
		shut up!

	Emil turns off the TV.  Our POV backs into the bathroom,
	closing the door but leaving it open a crack.  Emil looks
	down at his shoe.  The POV PANS down to the kitchen knife
	sticking out of Emil&#39;s BOOT.  Emil&#39;s hands pull his pants
	cuff over it.  POV PANS up to Emil as he moves to the door
	and opens it.  It&#39;s not Daphne and she&#39;s not world class.

				HONEY
		Hi, I&#39;m Honey.

				EMIL
		Where&#39;s Czech girl?

				HONEY
		Baby, I&#39;m anybody you want me to be. 
		I&#39;m a little schoolgirl, I&#39;m mommy, I&#39;m
		a Czech girl.

	She enters.  Closes the door behind her.

				HONEY (CONT&#39;D)
		Now I like to get business out of the
		way before we get down to pleasure.  Why
		don&#39;tchya put my money on the dresser.

				EMIL
		I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you
		know her?

	Oleg ZOOMS in for a CLOSE UP of Honey.  During the rest of
	the scene Oleg films her.  Honey begins to undress.

				HONEY
		It&#39;s an outcall service run out of an
		apartment.  I don&#39;t meet the other
		girls.  Aren&#39;t you gonna get undressed?

				EMIL
		Where is escort service?

				HONEY
		That&#39;s confidential.  Could you put the
		money on the dresser?

				EMIL
		I like to talk to the person who runs
		the service.  Can you give me address?

				HONEY
		Look.  Do we have a problem here? 
		There&#39;s no reason to have a problem. 
		I&#39;m gonna make you feel real good.  You
		wanna Czech girl? 
		After I&#39;m done with you, you won&#39;t miss
		her.  Now why don&#39;t you pay me?

	She starts to unfasten Emil&#39;s belt.

				EMIL
			(stopping her)
		Listen to me.  I don&#39;t want sex.  Just
		give me the address and then you go.

				HONEY
			(suddenly hard as nails)
		Look, man, I don&#39;t give a shit if you
		want sex or not, but you&#39;re payin&#39; for
		my time.

	Emil pulls the knife out of his boot and SHOVES her against
	the door, PUSHING the blade against her throat - suddenly
	furious like he was before killing Milos and Tamina.

				EMIL
		Give me the address!!

				HONEY
		Alright, alright - don&#39;t hurt me! 
		Please, it&#39;s in my book, in my purse!

	Emil backs off as she reaches for her purse, and comes out
	with a can of mace, SPRAYING Emil&#39;s face!

	Emil stumbles backwards - Oleg holding him in the frame.  He
	WHIP PANS back to Honey as she grabs her clothes, unlocking
	the door but Emil&#39;s HAND SLAMS it shut!  Emil turns blindly,
	rubbing his burning eyes - guarding the door.  Honey darts
	toward the bathroom - she pushes open the door and runs into
	Oleg who is VIDEOTAPING HER.  Horrified, she turns around as
	Emil SMASHES her in the face so hard she topples backwards,
	tripping into the bathtub, pulling the shower curtain down on
	her!  Like a panther out for the kill, Emil POUNCES.  Oleg
	films as Emil lifts his hand, gripping...

	THE KITCHEN KNIFE

	As Emil&#39;s hand comes FLYING DOWN - then RISES UP, BLOODIED. 
	Her screams are muffled by the shower curtain wrapped around
	her face.  Oleg films the scene as the knife plunges DOWN
	INTO:
		
		INT. FIRE STATION 91 - ARSON SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

	DAPHNE, a sketch of her face.

				JORDY (O.S.)
		Her lips are fuller than that.  You can
		see &#39;em a mile away.

	WIDER

	Food containers are scattered all over the place.  The female
	COMPOSITE ARTIST looks at Jordy.  Stacks of failed sketches
	sit beside her.

				COMPOSITE ARTIST
		What about her cheek bones?

				JORDY
		Her cheek bones are prominent and her
		eyes were huge.  Big, blue eyes and when
		I saw her, she looked scared.  Like she
		was looking to get away.  But she was
		absolutely beautiful.

	The composite artist looks at Jordy.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		I gotta good look at her.

	Korfin has his chair turned around from his desk and is
	watching the sketch evolve as he speaks on the phone to the
	landlord of the 7th Street brownstone.  Garcia is also on the
	phone.  The other investigators are gone.  Working late into
	the night.  Everybody&#39;s exhausted.  It&#39;s almost dawn.

				KORFIN
		-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long
		have they been livin&#39; in your building?  
			(writes 4 YEARS on his pad)
		Alright, I&#39;ll be in touch when we know
		somethin&#39;.
			(to Jordy)
		Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were
		quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord
		don&#39;t know who your girl is.

				JORDY
		How long they been livin&#39; here?

				KORFIN
		You hear that question, Garcia?

				GARCIA
		Yeah, I got Immigration on the phone -
		they&#39;ve been here illegally.

				KORFIN
		Well, they&#39;re definitely permanent
		residents now.

				GARCIA
		I got the owner of the plumbing company
		Milos worked for.

				KORFIN
		Why don&#39;t we get some sleep and we&#39;ll go
		see him in the morning.

				JORDY
		You go home.  I&#39;m takin&#39; your car and
		goin&#39; back to the crime scene.

				KORFIN
		Aren&#39;t you tired?

				JORDY
		If I go home I won&#39;t be able to fall
		asleep anyway.

	Jordy takes the sketch of Daphne which isn&#39;t a bad likeness
	and heads for the door.  Korfin falls in behind him.  As they
	pass Garcia he hands Jordy the address.

				KORFIN
			(of the picture)
		She keepin&#39; you up?  Like to meet her,
		huh?  She&#39;d make you forget your ex
		wife.  Cure your insomnia.

	INT. MILOS&#39; APARTMENT - DAWN

	CAMERA DESCENDS FROM THE SKY picking up Jordy as he enters
	what is left of Milos and Tamina&#39;s apartment.  The roof has
	been burned off. He moves into the next room, trying to see
	through the darkness - looking through the muck and char.

				EDDIE
		Okay to smoke?

	Jordy turns, surprised.  Eddie sits on a singed chair.  He
	pours from a half-pint bottle of vodka into his &#39;won ton
	soup&#39; container, smoking a cigar.  On the arm of the armchair
	is a brown legal folder and stacks of photographs of the
	crime scene and the burned bodies.

				JORDY
		It&#39;s your crime scene now.  You can do
		what you want.

				EDDIE
		Watch the news?

				JORDY
		Nah, I musta missed it.

				EDDIE
		Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys
		the credit.

				JORDY
		Well, just so you know, I don&#39;t care
		about that stuff.

				EDDIE
		Nah, why should you?

				JORDY
		I don&#39;t even watch TV.

				EDDIE
		Good.  Good.  Commendable.

	Eddie knocks his &#39;won ton soup&#39; back.

				JORDY
		Did you get a report from the M.E.?

				EDDIE
		Sure.  But I would like to ask you
		something.  You got a problem with me?

				JORDY
		If you found me steppin&#39; on your crime
		scene - it might piss you off, too.
			(then)
		What about the report?

				EDDIE
		You were right, they were both dead
		before the fire.  The male was stabbed
		so hard the killer broke off the tip of
		the knife in his spine.  That&#39;s usually
		an indicator of something personal.

	Jordy pulls out a sketch of Daphne.  Hands it to Eddie.

				JORDY
		The Super said he&#39;d seen her before but
		she didn&#39;t live here.

				EDDIE
		Pretty.

				JORDY
			(acts as if he didn&#39;t notice)
		Hmmmm.

				EDDIE
		Maybe you don&#39;t care about that either.
			(beat)
		Prettiest suspect I&#39;ve had in awhile.

				JORDY
		Who says she&#39;s a suspect?

	Jordy tries to take the sketch back.  Eddie holds on.

				EDDIE
		What would you call her?

				JORDY
		Look, I&#39;m not even sure she has anything
		to do with this.  I saw her outside
		after the fire - thought it was a lead. 
		Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was
		visiting somebody here.  Who knows?

	Eddie walks up to the burnt mattress - where the bodies were.

				EDDIE
		Obviously they weren&#39;t having sex.  As
		you pointed out.  So why go through all
		the trouble of putting &#39;em like that?

	Eddie passes a crime scene photo of the bodies to Jordy.

				JORDY
		Maybe it&#39;s a ritual thing or someone
		trying to send a message.  Burial rites
		are taken very seriously in Eastern
		Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. 
		Just burning them up, no proper funeral,
		it&#39;s like condemning them to hell.

				EDDIE
		Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? 
		Hungary?

				JORDY
		Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been
		fighting the Germans and the Russians
		for a thousand years.  These are very
		intense people and they take things
		personally.

	Eddie&#39;s cellular rings - he grabs it.

				EDDIE
		Yeah?  Where?  You sure it was a knife? 
		Uh-huh.  Really?  Okay.
			(to Jordy)
		We&#39;ve got another murder - in a hotel on
		Eighth Avenue.  A stabbing.  Clerk said
		the room was rented by a Russian...

	Eddie&#39;s moving with Daphne&#39;s sketch. 

				JORDY
		I&#39;ll come with you.

				EDDIE
		There wasn&#39;t a fire.  There&#39;ll be
		nothing for you to do.

				JORDY
		I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I&#39;ll
		learn something.

				EDDIE
		This isn&#39;t homicide school.

				JORDY
		My parents are from Poland.  I can help
		with the Eastern European angle.

				EDDIE
		You&#39;re Polish?

				JORDY
		My folks are.

				EDDIE
		Stay here.
						

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NEWS STAND - DAY

	Video POV of the news stand as a hand reaches into frame and
	picks up a copy of THE NEW YORK POST.  Eddie&#39;s photo is on
	the front page - holding the kitchen timer by the wires. 
	Underneath his picture the caption reads, &quot;DOUBLE HOMICIDE...
	FLEMMING&#39;S ON IT.&quot;  The videocamera widens out revealing Emil
	standing in front of a Times Square news stand, reading the
	front page.  The videocamera turns around - until focusing on
	Oleg himself.

				OLEG
		This is second day in America.  First
		day was very exciting.  Full of thrills
		and chills.  Over there, is co-star of
		my new movie, Emil!

	He turns the camera around - FILMING EMIL.

				EMIL
			(to vendor)
		Who is he?

				VENDOR
		New York&#39;s finest.  This is his case.

	The VENDOR - picks up People.  Stephen Geller is on the
	cover.

				VENDOR (CONT&#39;D)
		This all you want?  

				EMIL
		Do you know how much killer gets for
		movie rights?

				VENDOR
			(People)
		In here, says he wants a million.

				EMIL
		Million?!  The killer gets one million
		dollars for a television interview?

				VENDOR
		Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous
		serial killer - half a million for his
		interview.  And how much you think
		Monica got for writing book about the
		President coming on to her?  It pays to
		be a killer or a whore in this country. 
		Look, you want magazine or not?

				EMIL
		Yes.  Both.

				OLEG
		And these.

	Oleg picks up FILM COMMENT, MOVIELINE and PREMIERE magazine. 
	Emil pays for everything.

				EMIL
			(to Oleg)
		Get a taxi.

	Oleg tucks the magazines in his coat, picks up the suitcases
	and hails a taxi.  As Emil collects his change he sees an old
	BLIND WOMAN waiting at the crosswalk.  The light&#39;s blinking
	WALK.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		Let me help.

	Emil gently takes her arm and crosses her to the other side.

				BLIND WOMAN
		Thank you, son.

	Emil watches her walk on.

	INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - DAY

	The hotel room is a hive of activity.  GIL is dusting the
	dresser for prints.  Another officer is stripping the bed and
	putting the bedding into a big, clear plastic bag.  As Eddie
	enters the crime scene, a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER is standing in
	the doorway taking pictures.

				EDDIE
		Where is she?

				LEON
		Takin&#39; a bath.

				EDDIE
		Any I.D.?

				LEON
		Still unknown but we&#39;re running prints. 
		Kid over there caught the case.

	Jordy enters.  Leon steps in his way.

				LEON (CONT&#39;D)
		Sorry...PD only.

				EDDIE
		It&#39;s okay.

	Eddie walks over to a young detective.  TOMMY CULLEN, only
	26, is excited to meet Eddie.

				TOMMY
		Tommy Cullen.  Heard a lot about you. 
		Nice to meet you.  Here&#39;s what we got. 
		A girl in there, figure her to be a
		prostitute, looks like she was fighting
		for her life.  She&#39;s got defense wounds
		on her hands.  Right this way - in the
		bathroom.

				EDDIE
		After you.

	Eddie follows Tommy into the bathroom.  There&#39;s blood
	splattered all over the walls and the floor.  Honey&#39;s topless
	body lies in the tub tangled in the bloody shower curtain. 
	MURPHY, an Irish medical examiner (M.E.), is examining the
	body.

				TOMMY
		Room was registered to a Francis Capra.

				JORDY
		Capra?  That&#39;s not Czech or Russian. 
		Who said he sounded Russian?

				TOMMY
		The clerk?

				EDDIE
		Check the switchboard, see what phone
		calls were made from this room.

				TOMMY
		I&#39;ll do it.

	Tommy heads out.  Eddie takes out his cigar holder.  Slides
	out what&#39;s left of his cigar.  Re-lights it.  Looks down at
	Honey&#39;s body in the bathtub.  Gil&#39;s dusting the tub for
	prints.

				MURPHY
		Clothes were off in the other room.  Tub
		is dry except for the blood.

				EDDIE
		Any of you guys take a piss lately?

	Gil looks confused.  Eddie points to the toilet.  Seat is up.

				EDDIE (CONT&#39;D)
		Do the seat for me.

	Gil crosses to the toilet and starts to dust it.  Eddie
	stands in the bathroom - studying the scene.  Holding the
	unlit cigar.  Looking around at the blood splattered walls.

				EDDIE (CONT&#39;D)
		Only one guys checked in?

				LEON
		Yeah.

				EDDIE
		C&#39;mere.  You wanna go to homicide
		school?  Here - make yourself useful.

	Eddie positions Jordy behind the tub next to the wall.

				EDDIE (CONT&#39;D)
		Our killer...our killer&#39;s standing here
		slashing at her.  She&#39;s fightin&#39; him. 
		The blood is splattering this way.  It&#39;s
		on this wall...
			(pointing to the right of
			 Jordy)
		And there&#39;s some specks over here.
			(to the left of Jordy)
		There&#39;s nothing here because someone was
		standing right here.  Someone big.  And
		he&#39;s got blood on him.  Lots of blood. 
		He wouldn&#39;t walk out of here like that.
			(turning to Murphy)
		Murphy, what kind of knife you think
		we&#39;re talking about here?

	Murphy pulls out a clear plastic ruler and walks over to the
	blood-splattered wall.

				MURPHY
		If you look here where he missed and hit
		the wall you see that the marks aren&#39;t
		deep but they&#39;re kinda wide... not your
		everyday kitchen or pocket knife.

				EDDIE
		What if the tip was broken off?

				MURPHY
		Could be.  Then we should find it here
		somewhere.

				EDDIE
		I think we&#39;ve already found it.

	Eddie exchanges a look with Jordy as Tommy, the young
	detective, returns.

				TOMMY
		There was only one call from this room
		last night.  I dialed it.  It&#39;s an
		escort service.

				LEON
		Did you identify yourself?

				TOMMY
		Hey, I&#39;m new but I&#39;m not stupid.

				EDDIE
		Call communications and get an address
		on that number.

	Tommy holds up a slip of paper with the outcall service
	address on it.

				EDDIE (CONT&#39;D)
		Good work.

	INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - STAIRS - DAY

	Jordy hurries out - catches up with Eddie.

				JORDY
		You goin&#39; to the escort service?

				EDDIE
		You got any better ideas?

				JORDY
		Mind if I ride along with you?

				EDDIE
		This has nothing to do with your fire.

				JORDY
		But what if it does?  You might need my
		help.

	As Eddie exits the hotel, a MAN approaches.

				MAN
		Hey, Eddie, can I get your autograph for
		my son?

	EXT. KING EDWARD HOTEL - DAY

	Jordy catches up.  Eddie finishes signing the autograph using
	the man&#39;s back.

				EDDIE
		I&#39;ll let you know what happens.

				JORDY
		This is ridiculous.  I&#39;m not gonna be in
		your way - we can talk the case over.

				EDDIE
		Tell you what - I&#39;ll flip you a coin. 
		If you win you can come with me.  If you
		don&#39;t win, you don&#39;t come.

				JORDY
		I&#39;ll call it... tails.

	Eddie pulls out a coin and hands it to Jordy.

				EDDIE
		Okay.  I&#39;ll call it.  Heads.

	Jordy flips the coin and it&#39;s heads.

				EDDIE (CONT&#39;D)
		Heads.  See, you lost twice.
			(beat)
		Okay.  Get in.

	Jordy goes for the passenger side of the car.  Before Jordy
	can get in, Eddie starts to pull away.  Jordy stands on the
	sidewalk - dejected.  Eddie stops the car again and this time
	lets Jordy get in.


				WHIP PAN TO:

	INT. UPPER EASTSIDE HALLWAY - DAY

	Eddie and Jordy arrive in front of Rose&#39;s door.  Eddie knocks
	and flips a coin to Jordy.

				EDDIE
		Oh here.  A souvenir.

	Jordy takes the quarter.  Not understanding what Eddie means. 
	He looks at the quarter.

				JORDY
		Two heads.

				EDDIE
		Better than one.

	Eddie suckered him with the coin toss.  Jordy reacts.  Eddie
	laughs - squirts Binaca in his mouth.  Knocks again.  We hear
	ROSE HELLER.

				ROSE (O.S.)
		Who&#39;s there?

				EDDIE
		Police.  We&#39;d like to ask you a few
		questions.

				ROSE (O.S.)
		I have nothin&#39; to say.  If you wanna
		contact my attorney...

				EDDIE
			(commands)
		Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It&#39;s Detective
		Eddie Flemming.  Open up.

	Rose reacts.  Immediately UNLOCKS, UNCHAINS and opens the
	door!  

				ROSE
		You!  I&#39;ve seen you on TV!

	Eddie glances self-consciously at Jordy.

				ROSE (CONT&#39;D)
		C&#39;mon in.  C&#39;mon in!

	INT. ROSE&#39;S APARTMENT - DAY

	They enter.

				ROSE
		Just a minute.  Shit.  And I don&#39;t have
		a camera.  Hold on a second.

	Rose moves back to the phone - finishes up her conversation
	in Afrikaner.  We hold on Eddie and Jordy at the door.  Eddie
	looks around - taking in the place.  FOUR GIRLS are on
	phones.  Two girls take orders for customers.  The other two
	work the phone sex lines.  Rose hangs up the phone - turns to
	Eddie and Jordy:

				ROSE (CONT&#39;D)
		What&#39;s wrong?

				EDDIE
		We don&#39;t have her I.D. yet, but one of
		your girls was killed last night at the
		King Edward Hotel.

				ROSE
		Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey&#39;s dead?

				JORDY
		Do you remember the man who called?

	Though Rose answers Jordy, she directs her response to Eddie.

				ROSE
		Yeah.  He wanted a girl from
		Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey
		&#39;cause once they get there, you know, it
		doesn&#39;t really matter - Honey was
		killed...?  Poor girl...

				EDDIE
		Do you have any Czech girls working for
		you?

				ROSE
		No.

				EDDIE
		Did you tell him you did?

	A BUTCH GIRL enters.  Rose speaks to her in Afrikaner.

				ROSE
			(Afrikaner)
		Boy, she&#39;s so popular all the sudden.

				EDDIE
		What are you saying?

				ROSE
		Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me
		about her, too.

	Jordy pulls out the sketch, unfolds it.

				JORDY
		This her?

				ROSE
		Yeah.  Sort of.  I tried to recruit her,
		gave her my card.  She said she&#39;d think
		about it but I never heard from her.

				BUTCH GIRL
			(Afrikaner)
		Beautiful eyes.

				EDDIE
		Who came by looking for her?

				ROSE
		He said he was her cousin.  I told him
		where she works.  They were just here.

				EDDIE
		Describe him.

				ROSE
		Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second
		guy with him was...shorter, with a
		wrestler&#39;s build.  And he wouldn&#39;t turn
		his videocamera off me.

				EDDIE
		He had a videocamera?  Where is she? 
		Quickly!

				ROSE
		She washes hair up at Ludwig&#39;s - a salon
		on 63rd and Madison.

	EXT. EDDIE&#39;S CAR - DAY

	As Eddie speeds through the street, SIREN BLARING.

	INT. EDDIE&#39;S CAR - DAY

	Jordy holds on as Eddie darts in and out of cars with
	astonishing dexterity.  This man can drive.  Eddie picks up
	his phone - dials.  Jordy is on his cell phone as well.

				EDDIE
		Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. 
		Hair salon.  Ludwig&#39;s. 

				JORDY
			(overlapping)
		I&#39;m on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig&#39;s. 
		63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be
		there already.

	Eddie looks over as Jordy disconnects.  Eddie picks up a beer
	he was holding between his legs - finishes it.

				EDDIE
		You thirsty?

				JORDY
		I&#39;m on duty.

				EDDIE
			(drinking)
		So am I.  Alright, I&#39;ll go inside and
		you cover the back.

				JORDY
		Of course.

				EDDIE
		Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I
		was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a
		door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and
		yelling &#39;Freeze!&#39; at the bad guy! 
		What&#39;d you dream about?

				JORDY
		I wanted to run up to a building on
		fire, kick in the door, rush into the
		smoke and save a kid.

				EDDIE
		Then I guess we&#39;re doin&#39; this the right
		way, aren&#39;t we?  If we pull up to a
		burning building I&#39;ll gladly let you go
		first.

	Jordy looks at Eddie - can&#39;t deny he&#39;s right.

	INT. LUDWIG&#39;S SALON - DAY

	We&#39;re in a moving video POV of Ludwig&#39;s, the hair salon -
	it&#39;s big and spacious.  The lens finds THE RECEPTIONIST.

				OLEG (O.S.)
		Daphne Handlova?

				RECEPTIONIST
		Daphne?  In the back.  Probably
		shampooing a customer&#39;s hair.

	Oleg approaches Daphne who is mixing hair dye.  LUDWIG, the
	owner, is with her.

				LUDWIG
		Why are you messing with your hair color
		again?  You&#39;re going to kill your hair. 
		You won&#39;t look good with black hair.

				DAPHNE
		I want to do it, alright?

				LUDWIG
		Well, then do it after work.  A
		customer&#39;s waiting.

	He leaves, a customer approaches.  She smiles at him - turns
	on the water in the sink then sees - Oleg filming her.  She
	backs up...suddenly moves to the emergency door!

	TO THE BACKYARD

	There&#39;s a garden out there.  Daphne runs toward the alley. 
	Oleg follows her - still videotaping.  As she rounds the
	corner she bumps into...Emil!  He pulls out his kitchen
	knife, shoving her against the wall, pushing the blade with
	the broken tip against her throat.

				EMIL
		I...I have a temper.

	She looks at him, not understanding.  Oleg films the scene.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		When I lose it, I lose control.  I
		didn&#39;t intend to kill Milos but he stole
		from me.  Cheated me!  When I went to
		prison, they beat me.  I still didn&#39;t
		tell he was my partner.  I loved Milos
		like a brother...

	The tone in Emil&#39;s voice - there&#39;s an uncharacteristic
	softness to it.  He wants to reconcile his behavior to her.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
			(in English)
		I&#39;m not a killer.

	The back door opens.  He shoves the knife in his pocket as
	Ludwig peers around the alleyway.  What he sees is Emil
	leaning close to Daphne, kissing her.

				LUDWIG
		Daphne, will you be coming back to work?

				DAPHNE
		In a minute, Ludwig.

	Ludwig leaves.

				EMIL
		Smart girl.  I&#39;m glad you&#39;re not a
		whore.  But washing hair?  This is no
		job for a woman as beautiful as you. 
		They should be washing your hair.

	Emil reaches into his pocket and pulls out SOMETHING, sticks
	it in the palm of her hand, closing her fingers around it.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		I don&#39;t want to kill you.  But if you
		talk, I will.
			(whispers)
		I thought you&#39;d want these.

	He taps her hand...he turns and goes out the rear exit.  Oleg
	follows.  Jordy arrives.

				JORDY
		...Daphne?

	She says nothing.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		I&#39;m a fire marshal.  You remember me
		from the other night?  You are Daphne,
		right?

	She says nothing.  Eddie arrives.  Daphne turns.  Recognizing
	Eddie.

				EDDIE
		You don&#39;t have to be afraid.  We&#39;re here
		to protect you.  Come with me.  We want
		to talk to you.  You speak English
		alright?

	Eddie looks at Jordy.  Takes Daphne by the arm.
		
		EXT. LUDWIG&#39;S SALON - CONTINUOUS

	As they come out, Eddie notices Daphne clutching something in
	her hand.  He reaches for her hand.  Opens it.  It&#39;s a
	brushed gold necklace.

				EDDIE
		Did he give you these?  Was he just
		here?

	Eddie searches the streets.  Notices Oleg and Emil on the far
	corner.  Oleg is videotaping him.  Leon and Tommy pull up. 
	Korfin behind.  They all pop out.  Eddie grabs Leon -
	squeezes his arm - quietly.

				EDDIE (CONT&#39;D)
		The other side of the street.  The guy
		with the videocamera.
			(back to Jordy)
		Don&#39;t look - put her in the car.
			(to Leon)
		Stay this side.

				LEON
			(back to Tommy)
		Stay with her.

	They start heading down the curb - trying not to attract the
	attention of Oleg and Emil.

	A VIDEO CLOSE-UP

	of the scene from across the corner.

				EMIL
			(Czech)
		Put the fuckin&#39; camera down!  Let&#39;s go!

	Emil starts to flee.

	EXT. NYC STREETS - CONTINUOUS

	What follows next is an incredible foot chase with Eddie,
	Jordy, Korfin and Leon running through traffic - chasing
	Emil.  Eddie tries to stay in the lead but is running out of
	breath.

				EDDIE
		Split up!

	Jordy runs down one side of Madison - Eddie, the other. 
	Korfin continues down 62nd and Leon covers the other side. 
	They search for Emil, grabbing people, turning them around,
	missing him.  Emil seems to have disappeared.

	Leon, gun raised, approaches the cafe.  As he rounds the
	corner, Emil darts out, cracking Leon across the face!  Leon
	crashes into a table, dropping his gun.  Emil scoops up the
	gun and PISTOL-WHIPS Leon.  BEATING the detective to a pulp. 
	People are running from the scene.  Emil takes Leon&#39;s wallet. 
	He is distracted by LAUGHTER.  Oleg is VIDEOTAPING the scene.

				OLEG
		Emil, look!

	Oleg swivels with the videocamera.  Korfin is running toward
	them - pushing through the crowd.  Emil FIRES!  Korfin is
	blown backwards.

				OLEG (CONT&#39;D)
		Perfect!  Cut.  Print!

	Eddie arrives.  Bends down to Leon, whose face is red with
	blood.  Jordy runs to Korfin, who&#39;s laying in the street,
	shot in the side.  Jordy cradles his partner.

				EDDIE
		Are you hit?

				LEON
		No.  I&#39;m okay.

				JORDY
			(to Korfin)
		Bobby, Bobby!  Where&#39;re you hit?!

				KORFIN
		It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!

				JORDY
		Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.

	Jordy looks up as Eddie steps into the center of the street. 
	Cars screech out of the way!  Eddie crouches, taking aim at
	Emil, who is almost two blocks away.  It&#39;s an impossible
	shot, out of range.

	But Eddie closes an eye, aims and squeezes off one SHOT.  Two
	blocks away, Emil topples.  Korfin and Jordy look at Eddie,
	astonished he made the shot.  Emil scrambles to his feet. 
	Runs.  Eddie holsters his weapon.  Pulls out a handkerchief. 
	Dabs Leon&#39;s wounds.

				LEON
		He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming
		the whole time!

				EDDIE
		I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don&#39;t
		worry, we&#39;ll get those fuckers.
						

				DISSOLVE TO:

	EMS VEHICLE

	Eddie and Jordy watch as Korfin on a stretcher, is loaded in
	an EMS VEHICLE and in b.g., an EMS DOCTOR attends to Leon&#39;s
	bloody face.  Eddie and Jordy turn to go back into the
	restaurant, now cleared out - as Nicolette Karas arrives with
	her cameraman.

				NICOLETTE
		Detective - can you tell us what
		happened here?

				EDDIE
		I can&#39;t talk right now.  We have some
		things to take care of.

	Jordy moves off, he doesn&#39;t want to get pulled in front of
	Nicolette.

	Daphne can be seen waiting in the back of the restaurant,
	maybe twenty feet away.  Tommy stands next to her.  This is
	where Eddie and Jordy are headed.

				NICOLETTE
		I understand, but I noticed that the
		Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this
		somehow related to the fire department?

				EDDIE
		I really can&#39;t give out any information
		right now at this point.

				NICOLETTE
		Okay.  But I do understand that your
		partner, Leon Jackson&#39;s been injured. 
		Is that correct?

				EDDIE
		He was hurt, but not seriously.  He&#39;ll
		be fine.

				NICOLETTE
		Do you have the suspect in custody?

				EDDIE
		Um...now is not a good time, okay. 
		Detective Jackson&#39;s hurt.  He&#39;s fine. 
		I&#39;ve got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective
		Jackson is hurt but not seriously.

				NICOLETTE
			(to cameraman)
		Alright, cut, cut, cut.

	Mike the cameraman cuts the cameraman - lowers it from his
	shoulder.

				NICOLETTE (CONT&#39;D)
			(to Eddie)
		Eddie, are you okay?

				EDDIE
		Yeah.  Now&#39;s not a good time.

				NICOLETTE
		Alright.

				EDDIE
		Alright?

				NICOLETTE
		Alright.

				EDDIE
		Alright.

				NICOLETTE
		Okay.

	Eddie walks into the restaurant.  Throws a look back at her,
	then enters.

	INT. ARMAND RESTAURANT - DAY

	Jordy talks to Daphne. 

				DAPHNE
		I told your partner, I can&#39;t help.  I
		didn&#39;t see anything.

				EDDIE
		C&#39;mon, start at the beginning.  You know
		these people?

				DAPHNE
		Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower
		was broken, she let me use theirs.

				EDDIE
		Go on.

	She says nothing.

				EDDIE (CONT&#39;D)
		Whether you tell us or not, we&#39;ll find
		out.  Better if it comes from you.

				DAPHNE
		If I tell you, will you arrest me?

				EDDIE
		Arrest you for what?  Why would we
		arrest you?

	She still hesitates.

				EDDIE (CONT&#39;D)
		What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid

				JORDY
		She just saw two of her friends killed! 
		They probably threatened her.

				EDDIE
		Is that all there is?

	She looks at Eddie.

				EDDIE (CONT&#39;D)
		Are you here illegally?  Don&#39;t worry
		about that.  We&#39;ll talk to Immigration. 
		They won&#39;t deport you.

				DAPHNE
		No, no, don&#39;t talk to Immigration!

	She clams up.

				JORDY
		Why not?

				EDDIE
		Something back home?

	Jordy leads Daphne to a table - she sits.  Eddie sits across
	from her.  Jordy crouches down next to her.

				DAPHNE
		...my little sister and I shared a flat -
		I came home one night and a man was
		raping her.  His gun was on the chair...
		He came at me and I shot him.

				JORDY
			(optimistic)
		Alright.  That&#39;s a justifiable homicide.

				DAPHNE
		Yes, but he was a cop.

				EDDIE
		A cop?

				DAPHNE
			(beat)
		I&#39;m from a small town in Slovakia.  Like
		the South here.  The Police is right, a
		civilian is wrong.  So I fled.

				EDDIE
		Look, we can help you but right now we
		have to deal with what&#39;s happening here. 
		Tell us the truth...is that the truth?

				DAPHNE
		You&#39;re a cop - you&#39;ll never believe me.

				JORDY
			(to Eddie)
		Can I talk to you?

	Eddie steps away with Jordy.  Keeping his eyes on Daphne. 
	She tries to listen.

				EDDIE
		She&#39;s fucked.  Even if that story is
		true.

				JORDY
		Raw deal.

	Eddie tilts his head.  Measures Jordy.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I
		get, they&#39;re all yours.  Just let me
		have a first crack at her.

				EDDIE
		You wanna talk to her alone?

				JORDY
		Yeah.

				EDDIE
		What would your girlfriend think of
		that?

				JORDY
		I don&#39;t have a girlfriend.

				EDDIE
		My point exactly.

				JORDY
		I&#39;m serious here.

				EDDIE
		So am I.

				JORDY
		C&#39;mon.  You intimidate her &#39;cause you&#39;re
		a celebrity.  She sees me differently.

				EDDIE
		You&#39;re her Savior?  Is she the kid
		you&#39;re gonna save from the burning
		building?

				JORDY
		You know what I&#39;m saying here.

	Eddie looks at his watch.  Thinks it over.  Measures Jordy.

				EDDIE
		Okay, tell you what, I&#39;ll give you a
		head start.  You take her to the station
		house.  Don&#39;t let her out of your sight. 
		She&#39;s the only warm body we got left.

				JORDY
		Hey.  I&#39;m a professional.

				EDDIE
		Women like that have a way of turning
		professionals into amateurs.

	He gives Jordy a look and heads for the door.

	INT. A SEEDY BATHROOM - DAY

	Emil pulls off his sock and shoe, lifts his foot into a
	stained sink and washes the blood away, exposing the chunk of
	pink flesh taken out of his ankle.  Emil grabs some toilet
	paper, plugs the wound, then cuts the towel off the dispenser
	with his kitchen knife and wraps his ankle.  He grits teeth
	in pain.  The lights go out.  Then Oleg adjusts the
	fluorescent light above the sink.

				OLEG
		Gotta light the scene better.  Now it&#39;s
		more moody... like a scene from THE
		THIRD MAN.

				EMIL
		Shut up.

				OLEG
		Does it hurt?

	Emil lifts his foot out of the sink.

				EMIL
		This is nothing.

	Emil lifts his shirt, exposing his back.

				OLEG
		Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!

				EMIL
		Don&#39;t want to film this?

	We don&#39;t see what Oleg sees - not yet - but from his
	expression, it&#39;s horrible.

	INT. JORDY&#39;S CAR - DAY

	Daphne rides in the backseat.  Jordy&#39;s watching her in the
	rearview.

				DAPHNE
		Now I become custody of police
		department?

				JORDY
		If you cooperate with the DA - maybe
		they&#39;ll help you with your situation.

				DAPHNE
		I will if they don&#39;t send me back.

				JORDY
		They won&#39;t until this is over.

	She looks away.  Out the window.  Jordy sees emotion filling
	her eyes.  She looks back at him - her eyes have teared up.

				DAPHNE
		Are you married?

				JORDY
		Divorced.

				DAPHNE
		Do you live alone?
			(beat)
		I&#39;ve been in these clothes since...the
		killings.  Could we stop at your place? 
		I could take a shower...before I go into
		custody?

	Jordy looks at her.  Can&#39;t quite tell if she&#39;s trying to
	manipulate him or really just wants to get cleaned up before
	all the shit starts.

				JORDY
		I can&#39;t take you to my place.

				DAPHNE
		Somewhere else?

	Jordy looks at her...
		

	EDDIE

	Staring right at us.

				EDDIE
		I want to talk to you about something
		serious.

	He holds up the diamond engagement ring.

				EDDIE (CONT&#39;D)
		I want to live the rest of my life with
		you...I don&#39;t know you&#39;ve been married
		before and I&#39;ve never been married, but
		I do love you, and...

	Eddie is standing in front of a mirror - rehearsing the
	proposal.  He notices a small dab of blood on his shirtcuff. 
	Leon&#39;s blood.  Paulie enters carrying a towel and a vodka
	tonic.

				PAULIE
		She&#39;s here.

	Paulie sets down the drink and begins their silent ritual. 
	He hands Eddie the towel.  Eddie wipes off his face and
	hands, then hands the towel back to Paulie.  Paulie helps
	Eddie on with his coat.  Eddie takes some Visine out of his
	coat pocket.  Drops a few in each eye.  HE straightens
	himself and looks in the mirror, taking a big gulp of the
	drink.  Eddie sets the glass down and starts out.  Paulie
	hands him a Binaca.  Eddie gives himself a squirt as he
	exits.  Paulie follows.

	INT. P.B. HERMAN&#39;S RESTAURANT - DAY

	It&#39;s lunchtime...it&#39;s crowded.  Eddie takes a seat at a
	table.  He takes the ring out of his pocket - holds it under
	the table.  Nicolette Karas walks up to Eddie from behind. 
	Gives him a kiss on the cheek.

				NICOLETTE
		Hey, honey.

				EDDIE
		Hey.

	She orders a drink in Greek from the Greek waiter, then sits
	down across the table.  There&#39;s a long pause - they just look
	at each other.

				NICOLETTE
		What is your problem?  Why&#39;d you snap at
		me?  I just wanted a statement.

				EDDIE
		I can&#39;t...I can&#39;t answer you just
		because you want me to answer you!

				NICOLETTE
		You didn&#39;t have to embarrass me in front
		of my colleagues.  You could give me
		something.

				EDDIE
		Oh, I&#39;m sorry.  Did I embarrass you,
		sweetheart?  Oh...

				NICOLETTE
		Stop it.

				EDDIE
		Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to
		the cameras and say, do you mind if we
		just work something out?

				NICOLETTE
		Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don&#39;t
		patronize me.

				EDDIE
		I&#39;m not.

				NICOLETTE
		Yes you are.  I&#39;m not just some
		reporter.  I don&#39;t just stick a
		microphone in your face.  You could give
		me something.

				EDDIE
		Yeah, well you took the camera and put
		it right down on the evidence.  That
		was...

				NICOLETTE
		That was good.  You were holding the
		evidence.

				EDDIE
		You were merciless.  You didn&#39;t give a
		shit if you got me or not.

				NICOLETTE
		Well, who was it that taught me how to
		do that?  Huh?

				EDDIE
		You&#39;re ruthless.

				NICOLETTE
		You&#39;re not so bad yourself.

	They look at each other.

				NICOLETTE (CONT&#39;D)
		C&#39;mere.

	They kiss.

				NICOLETTE (CONT&#39;D)
		Look at this.  You have blood on your
		shirt.  Whose is it?

				EDDIE
		Could be Leon&#39;s.

				NICOLETTE
		Jesus.  And last week you came over with
		blood on your shoes.  What am I going to
		do with you?

	Eddie takes her hand.

				EDDIE
		You know, I been thinkin&#39;...these shoes
		might look nice with another pair of
		shoes next to them in the closet.

	She looks at him.

				EDDIE (CONT&#39;D)
		You know, Nicky, I&#39;ve been married twice
		before.  My first wife was a
		professional woman, didn&#39;t have time for
		children.  My second wife...I never
		wanted to go home to her.

	Nicolette&#39;s phone rings.  Eddie stops - looks at the ringing
	phone.

				NICOLETTE
		What are you doing?  What are you
		saying?

	Nicolette&#39;s phone keeps ringing.  Eddie stares at it.

				NICOLETTE (CONT&#39;D)
		Eddie?

	Nicolette&#39;s phone keeps ringing.

				NICOLETTE (CONT&#39;D)
		Don&#39;t worry about the damn phone.  I
		won&#39;t answer it.

				EDDIE
		Answer the phone.

				NICOLETTE
		No.  Tell me what you want to say.

				EDDIE
		Answer it.

				NICOLETTE
		Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for
		a second.  They only call me when it&#39;s
		an emergency.  Just hold that thought.
			(into the phone)
		Can you call back?

				PHONE VOICE (O.S.)
		We need you here in twenty minutes.  Get
		in a cab.

				NICOLETTE
		What&#39;re you talking about?

				PHONE VOICE (O.S.)
		Katie.  We don&#39;t know where she is.  We
		can&#39;t find her.  You gotta anchor the
		5:00.  This is your shot.  Come now.

				NICOLETTE
		What?  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah.

	The line disconnects.  She collapses the phone.  Turns to
	Eddie.

				NICOLETTE (CONT&#39;D)
		Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They
		want me to anchor tonight!

				EDDIE
		That&#39;s good.

				NICOLETTE
		Yeah.

				EDDIE
		Well, that&#39;s great.

				NICOLETTE
		Okay.  That is great.  But I can&#39;t go
		now, we&#39;re in the middle of something
		here.

				EDDIE
		No.  Go ahead.  You&#39;re gonna be great.

				NICOLETTE
		No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to
		know what you&#39;re talking about.  You
		know, the shoe thing and the marriages
		and...

				EDDIE
		I&#39;ll tell you tonight.  Let&#39;s do it
		tonight.  As soon as you get back we&#39;ll
		talk.  We&#39;ll talk.

				NICOLETTE
		Promise?

				EDDIE
		I promise.  We&#39;ll talk.  You&#39;ll be
		great.  You&#39;ll be fine.  Go ahead, just
		imagine that, uh... Just look into the
		lens and imagine you&#39;re talking to me.

				NICOLETTE
		Yeah.  I&#39;ll do that.  As long as you&#39;re
		not patronizing me.

				EDDIE
		Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.

				NICOLETTE
		I love you.

	They kiss.

				NICOLETTE (CONT&#39;D)
		Okay, til tonight.

				EDDIE
		Tonight.

				NICOLETTE
		You promise?

				EDDIE
		Yeah.  I promise.

				NICOLETTE
		Okay.  And you know what, I&#39;ll swing by
		my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes
		and maybe just test them out next to
		yours...How&#39;s that... Would that be a
		good thing.

				EDDIE
		Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.

				NICOLETTE
		Okay.

				EDDIE
		See you later.  Good luck.

				NICOLETTE
		Thank you.

				EDDIE
		Don&#39;t be late.

	She walks out.

	INT. FIRE STATION 91 - DAY

	Jordy unlocks the door.  Enters with Daphne.  The fire
	station is empty.

				JORDY
		The men are out of quarters - practicing
		putting out fires.

				DAPHNE
		So...the station is empty?

				JORDY
		Yeah.  This way.

	He gestures toward the stairs.

	INT. FIRE STATION LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Jordy and Daphne walk through the locker room.  Her eyes
	never leaving Jordy&#39;s.

				JORDY
		You considered becoming a prostitute?

				DAPHNE
		Yes, I considered it.

				JORDY
		Did you ever turn tricks before?

				DAPHNE
		No.

				JORDY
		What about back home?

				DAPHNE
		No.

	Daphne stops.  Looks at him.  Stands very close.

				DAPHNE (CONT&#39;D)
		I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no
		one.  I couldn&#39;t get a job because you
		have to have a green card to get work. 
		They approached me - I could&#39;ve made a
		lot of money.  I considered it, but...
		it&#39;s not who I am.  They pay me below
		the table at Ludwig&#39;s.

				JORDY
		So you were never a prostitute?

				DAPHNE
		What are you asking me?

				JORDY
		I&#39;m just trying to find out who you are.

	She looks up into his eyes.  Searching.  Thinking he&#39;s
	hinting.

				DAPHNE
		Can you let me go?

	She leans in close to him - giving him the opportunity to
	kiss her.  Jordy is tempted but...remembers Eddie&#39;s warning
	and backs up slightly.

				JORDY
		Showers are this way.

	Desperate now, willing to do anything, Daphne moves in even
	closer.

				DAPHNE
		You could shower with me.

	Jordy is locked in her eyes.  Almost giving in.  Then breaks
	away.  Gestures towards the showers. 
	Daphne looks away form him - crestfallen.  She heads to the
	showers.  Jordy follows her into the bathroom.  The walls are
	lined with shower stalls.

				JORDY
		I&#39;ll uh, I&#39;ll get you a towel.

	He leaves her there.  Alone.  She quickly moves to the
	window.  Opens it.  Looks down.  It&#39;s a two-story drop to the
	street.

	JORDY

	gets a towel from the locker room.  His beeper goes off.  He
	checks the number but decides not to return the call.  We
	follow him back into the bathroom.  The shower is on but he
	notices the window.  It&#39;s open.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		Shit!

	He rushes over.  He looks out.  No sign of her.  He turns -
	looks back at the shower.  It&#39;s on but he can&#39;t see through
	the curtain.  Can&#39;t tell if she&#39;s there.  He walks over -
	quickly - fearing that she&#39;s left.  He pulls the curtain
	aside.  She&#39;s crouched in the corner shower stall.  Holding
	herself.  She looks up at him - her eyes filled with tears.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		Are you alright?

	Jordy sits on the bench next to the shower.

				DAPHNE
		I&#39;m not a whore.  I&#39;m not a whore.

				JORDY
		I know.

				DAPHNE
		You don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m sorry.  I was
		desperate.  That&#39;s not me.  I shot a
		cop.  Can you imagine what they&#39;ll do to
		me when I got to prison?

				JORDY
		They&#39;re not gonna send you right back.

				DAPHNE
		I&#39;m sorry.  I didn&#39;t mean to...I&#39;m glad. 
		Actually I&#39;m glad it&#39;s over.  All this
		time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look
		anyone in the eyes. 
		Always afraid that someone would find
		out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...

	He covers her with the towel, pulling her up.

				JORDY
		You can trust me.

	She embraces him.  Trusting him.  He stands there for a
	moment.  Then awkwardly holds her.  Comforting her.
		
		INT. NYC RESTAURANT - DAY

	CLOSE UP

	on a steak.  Male hands cut a piece.  Another male hand sets
	down a huge bottle of Extra Strength Excedrin.  The hands
	abandon the steak and rip open the bottle.  The CAMERA pulls
	back to include the LCD screen of Oleg&#39;s videocamera.  He is
	taping Emil as he rips open the safety plastic with his
	teeth.  Emil is sweating with fever and his eyes are glazed
	over in pain.  He &#39;drinks&#39; pills from the bottle and chews
	them up.  Wincing in pain.  Emil washes them down with a
	beer.

	Emil looks down and the camera follows his gaze to the
	&quot;People&quot; magazine article he&#39;s reading on Stephen Geller. 
	Emil laughs.  Shaking his head at the article as the
	videocamera tilts back up to his face.

				OLEG
		What is it?

				EMIL
		The video of Milos and Tamina - I told
		you to erase it.

				OLEG
		I did.

				EMIL
		And the whore&#39;s murder?  You didn&#39;t
		erase that either, did you?  Don&#39;t lie,
		I won&#39;t be angry.

				OLEG
		Why not?

				EMIL
		Put the camera down, Oleg.

	Oleg closes the LCD screen and puts the camera down.  Emil
	removes a small address book -- from Leon&#39;s wallet - he looks
	up Eddie Flemming&#39;s name.

				OLEG
		What is that?

				EMIL
		What does it look like?  It&#39;s an address
		book!

	Oleg jumps up with the camera to tape the book.

				OLEG
		Let me get a shot of it.

				EMIL
		Sit down!

				OLEG
		This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.

	Oleg gets a shot and quickly sits back down.

				OLEG (CONT&#39;D)
		Why won&#39;t you be angry at me for keeping
		my movie?

	Emil takes a gulp of beer - drops cash on the table and limps
	away.  Oleg follows.
		

	INT. PRECINCT - DAY

	It&#39;s quiet - Chief Duffy paces in front of the Sergeant&#39;s
	desk.  Looking at his watch.  Growing more and more
	aggravated as every second ticks by.  Jordy enters escorting
	Daphne.  Sees Duffy and tires to go past him.  Duffy turns
	and sees Jordy and Daphne.

				DUFFY
		Hey.  Warsaw.

	Jordy stops and comes back.  Sitting Daphne down on a bench.

				JORDY
		Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?

				DUFFY
		I came to see how the investigation was
		going.
			(looks at Daphne)
		I called and you&#39;re not here.  I wait up
		at the station and you don&#39;t even show
		up!!!  I beep you - you don&#39;t return my
		call.  Where the hell have you been?!

	Jordy takes a few steps away from Daphne.

				JORDY
		Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. 
		We stopped there... so she could get
		cleaned up.

				DUFFY
		What do you mean, &#39;cleaned up?&#39;

				JORDY
		I let her take a shower.

				DUFFY
		A shower!?  Did you take one, too?

				JORDY
		No!  Nothing happened.

				DUFFY
		Oh really.  That&#39;s nice.  You took a
		homicide witness to take a shower after
		your partner was shot?  Are you out of
		your fucking mind??  Are you having that
		much trouble gettin&#39; dates?!

				EDDIE (O.S.)
		I told him to take her there.

	Jordy and Duffy turn.  Eddie walks out.  Eddie turns - Tommy -
	the young detective who caught the case in the King Edward
	Hotel - is coming out of the back office.

				EDDIE (CONT&#39;D)
		Tommy, get her outta here.

	Tommy takes Daphne into the precinct.

				TOMMY
		This way, ma&#39;am.

				EDDIE
		There was too much press hangin&#39; around
		there.  I didn&#39;t want her face on the
		news.  So I told him to take her to a
		quiet area until things settled down.

				DUFFY
		Oh.

				EDDIE
		It was my decision, not his.

				DUFFY
		Well, I&#39;m the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall
		and every now and then I&#39;d like to be
		included in decisions.

				EDDIE
		Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do
		the press conference.  How about that? 
		The case is all yours.

				DUFFY
		Oh yeah...?  Alright.

				EDDIE
			(to Jordy)
		I&#39;m ready to be briefed.
			(to Duffy)
		Excuse us.

				DUFFY
			(to Eddie)
		Yeah, sure.
			(to Jordy)
		Beep me when you&#39;re ready for the press
		conference.

				JORDY
		Will do, Chief.

	Eddie leads the way, walking past the Sergeant&#39;s desk -
	toward the back and to his office.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		Eddie, I...

	Eddie holds up his hand - silencing Jordy.

				EDDIE
		Wait.

	INT. POLICE PRECINCT - DETECTIVE ROOM&#39;S SQUAD - DAY

	A handful of detectives talk about work over burned coffee. 
	Eddie enters with Jordy.

				EDDIE
		Guys...give me a few minutes?

	They empty out.

				JORDY
		Look, Eddie, I&#39;m tellin&#39; you - I didn&#39;t
		touch her.

				EDDIE
		Well, you shoulda because nobody&#39;s gonna
		believe you didn&#39;t...including me.

				JORDY
		I took her there for a shower and that&#39;s
		it.

				EDDIE
		Just a shower?

	Eddie gives Jordy a questioning look.

				JORDY
		Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing
		happened.  Look, I&#39;m sure you probably
		think I&#39;m a fool and I fucked up, but...

				EDDIE
		No, I don&#39;t think you were a fool, I
		just think you were stupid about it.  I
		mean, to say the least, you outta know
		better.  You don&#39;t know her well enough. 
		She&#39;s got the potential to fucking hang
		you even if she suggests that you made a
		pass at her, it&#39;s fuckin&#39; over.  You can
		deny it all you want, but it will not
		make one fucking bit of difference. 
		You&#39;re dead.

				JORDY
		I told you, you know, I thought I was
		doing the right thing, you know, I think
		she&#39;s innocent.

				EDDIE
		Well, it&#39;s not up to you to decide
		whether she&#39;s innocent or not.  Don&#39;t
		you understand, that&#39;s why you&#39;re a
		professional.

				JORDY
		But, I mean, didn&#39;t you ever go out on a
		limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda
		heard her there.  Tellin&#39; her whole
		story...I believed her.

				EDDIE
		How you go out on a limb for somebody is
		by giving her a number of an Immigration
		lawyer.  Here, here&#39;s a number of an
		Immigration lawyer.  That&#39;s how you help
		her. 
		But you can&#39;t get involved in her like
		that.  You&#39;re gonna jeopardize your
		career, your life and you&#39;re gonna
		jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you
		another piece of advice.  Maybe you
		don&#39;t watch TV but I&#39;ll let you in on a
		little secret - the whole fuckin&#39; world
		watches television.  And when you get
		out there, they know your face.  And the
		little fame, the little fuckin&#39; itty
		bitty fame that I get in this city makes
		it a lot easier for my job.  And I get
		more done because of it.

	Jordy studies Eddie for a quiet beat.

				JORDY
		Why&#39;d you help me back there with the
		Chief?  Why&#39;d you stand up for me like
		that?

				EDDIE
		You know, I don&#39;t know.  I like you. 
		You remind me of a puppy I used to have. 
		He pissed on the rug all the time, but I
		still kept him.

	Eddie picks up his cigar that&#39;s going out.  He sticks it in
	his mouth.  A match is lit.  He looks up.  Jordy holds the
	match.  Eddie dips the end of the cigar and puffs.  The
	homicide detective and the fire marshal hold a look.
		

	INT. EDDIE&#39;S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Eddie walks in - carrying flowers.  He closes and locks the
	door behind him.  He grabs the phone.  Dials.

				EDDIE
		It&#39;s Flemming...anything turn up?  Did
		they check the hospitals?  Airports? 
		Yeah, I hit him!  I fuckin&#39; hit him!  We
		should be all over everywhere - with
		dogs, choppers, everything!  These guys
		are from fuckin&#39; Czechoslovakia...

	He looks at the flowers.  Decides to put the case behind him
	for a moment.

				EDDIE (CONT&#39;D)
		I&#39;ll call you later.

	He HANGS up.  Arranges the flowers in a vase.  So they look
	perfect.  Sets them on the coffee table.  Fills out a card,
	writes, &quot;Nicky, I love you. 
	Will you marry me?&quot;  He sticks the card in the flowers -
	turns the lights down low.  Puts a romantic Sinatra song on
	the stereo.  Moves to the liquor cabinet.  Pours himself a
	drink.  He sets the ringbox on the coffee table - next to the
	flowers.  There&#39;s a knock at the door.

				EDDIE (CONT&#39;D)
		Coming!

	Eddie smooths his hair, unlocks the door.  But the hallway is
	empty.

				EDDIE (CONT&#39;D)
		Nicky!?!?

	No answer.  Eddie steps out in the hallway with the drink in
	his hand.  Walks toward the elevator.  Doesn&#39;t notice the
	shadow that passes behind him - entering his apartment. 
	Eddie turns.  No sign of anyone.

				EDDIE (CONT&#39;D)
		Nicky?!

	He walks back toward his apartment.  Turns and locks the
	door.  A BLUR jumps out of the shadows SLAMMING him on the
	head with a gun.  Eddie tumbles to the floor!  OUT COLD!

	A BLURRED VIDEO IMAGE

	as it&#39;s focused - on Eddie - handcuffed and upper body taped
	to a chair - 20 minutes later - sobered up.  Emil is sitting
	in front of him.  On the coffee table alongside him are the
	flowers in a vase.  They&#39;ve ransacked the place.  Emil has
	Eddie&#39;s watch, his gold shield and his money.  He&#39;s smoking
	one of Eddie&#39;s cigars and in Emil&#39;s hand...is the diamond
	engagement ring and card.  Oleg, 60 MINUTES-style, is
	positioned behind Emil videotaping Eddie.  He moves to the
	corner of the room - bringing a light back over to illuminate
	Eddie&#39;s face.

				EMIL
		So...who&#39;s Nicky?

				EDDIE
		What do you want?

				EMIL
		Your opinion.
			(leaning forward)
		You see, they going to make a movie
		about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.

				EDDIE
			(sarcastic)
		What&#39;s your accomplishment.

				EMIL
		I kill someone famous.

				EDDIE
		Then do it, asshole.

				EMIL
		Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who
		plays you will want to die like hero.

	Eddie looks at the videocamera.  Emil answers Eddie&#39;s look.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		So tabloids don&#39;t have to do re
		enactments.  They going to have real
		movie this time.

				EDDIE
		If you kill me and film it you&#39;re
		putting a noose around your neck.

	Emil turns to Oleg.

				EMIL
		Turn it off.

	Oleg obeys.  Emil turns to Eddie.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy
		men would film their murders?
			(gestures to Eddie)
		So we kill someone famous and if we are
		caught, we are sent to mental hospital. 
		But what good is money there?  Because
		once in hospital I say I not crazy. 
		Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see
		psychiatrists.  They must certify we are
		sane and because of your - what is law
		called?
			(Eddie says nothing)
		Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double
		Jeopardy law, we can&#39;t be tried for same
		crime twice.  We come out free, rich and
		famous!

				OLEG
		Good idea!

				EDDIE
		You really think you&#39;ll be able to fool
		a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin&#39;
		stupid are you?

				EMIL
		Smarter than Americans.  You&#39;re fed cry
		baby talk shows all day long.  Not only
		will Americans believe me, they&#39;ll cry
		for me.
			(laughs)
		So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you
		like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? 
		Maybe you can propose to her now?

	Eddie says nothing.  Just stares at Emil.  Emil puffs on
	Eddie&#39;s cigar.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		Okay.  He has nothing to say.
			(signaling Oleg)
		Start the camera!

				OLEG
		Cut!

	Emil looks at Oleg.

				OLEG (CONT&#39;D)
		This is my project.  I say &#39;action.&#39;  I
		am the director!  You are the talent. 
		You wait for me to say &#39;action!&#39;

	Emil looks at Eddie as if to say, &quot;See what I have to put up
	with.&quot;  Oleg gestures from behind the videocamera.

				OLEG (CONT&#39;D)
		And...action!

	Oleg FILMS as Emil raises Eddie&#39;s service revolver.  Eddie
	suddenly KICKS at Emil&#39;s hand, but Emil pulls it away,
	backing out of Eddie&#39;s reach.

				EMIL
		Bad last moment - I cut that out.

	Emil raises the pistol again - pointing the gun at Eddie&#39;s
	left temple.  Emil cocks the hammer, but Eddie avoids the
	gun, ducking his head to the side of Emil&#39;s arm.  Standing
	and following his head up Emil&#39;s arm and pushing him over
	into the desk.  Eddie then knocks Emil with the chair and
	Emil falls off the desk and onto the floor.

	Oleg still grips the videocamera.  Eddie continues around
	with the chair and drives Oleg back across the room - pinning
	him to the wall.

	Eddie comes back from Oleg to the gun at the same time as
	Emil is limping for it.  Eddie knocks Emil out of the way
	with the chair and then stabs him with the legs of the chair
	repeatedly.

	Eddie comes up and around again at Oleg who is coming at him
	from the wall.  Eddie knocks Oleg over the coffee table and
	onto the sofa.  Falling on top of him, rolling over and
	leaving Oleg on the sofa.

	Eddie manages to get up from the sofa and position the chair
	in such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the
	gun.  Emil limps toward the gun at the same time and it is
	not clear in the darkness who has the gun.

	Oleg gets up from the sofa and goes over to get the
	videocamera.  Eddie has managed to get the gun and comes up
	as Oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting
	toward Oleg - managing to shoot one of the blinds off the
	window and one of the lampshades off the lamp.

	Oleg crouches down with the camera and Eddie starts to turn
	toward Emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him in
	the stomach.

	Emil steps back, revealing the knife is BURIED IN EDDIE&#39;S
	STOMACH.

	Eddie stumbles backward, falling over but still attached to
	the chair - holding the gun.  Eddie can&#39;t believe he got
	stabbed.  Blood swells around his stomach.  He can&#39;t be
	dying.  This can&#39;t be happening.  He looks at Emil.  The pain
	is terrible.  Oleg has knelt down next to Eddie - getting a
	close up.

	Emil looks at Eddie.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		Die.  Die.

	Emil looks around.  Grabs a black pillow and finishes Eddie
	off, suffocating him.
		

	BLACKNESS

	We are moving through a tunnel - pitch black, so dark all you
	feel is the motion.  We are travelling very fast.  Finally,
	in the distance, a speck of light which fills the frame. 
	We slowly pull back from the white light to discover it is a
	tiny pixel on a TV screen.

	WIDENING

	further out we see Eddie&#39;s funeral on the evening news.  It&#39;s
	an enormous gathering - a sea of blue uniforms and
	dignitaries.  In the upper right hand corner, superimposed
	over the funeral, is a picture of Eddie from his ID and in
	his NYPD uniform.  We see Oleg&#39;s reflection on the set with
	the videocamera.  He is filming the TV.  We hear the audio
	from Eddie&#39;s funeral.

				NEWSCASTER (ON T.V.)
		..Detective Flemming was one of the most
		decorated NYPD detectives in the history
		of New York.  He made several thousand
		arrests during his career, including the
		famed Stephen Geller case.  Beloved by
		the community in which he served.  His
		partner eulogized him...

	Leon is at the mic. 

				LEON (ON T.V.)
		...Eddie was my mentor, my best friend
		and my partner...he taught me the
		meaning of the word &#39;cop.&#39;  He was a man
		in every sense of the word.  I&#39;ll miss
		him...
			(choking on tears)
		Sleep well, brother.

	Leon begins to sing &quot;Amazing Grace.&quot;  Oleg PANS from the TV
	and focuses it on a lightbulb.  Hands enter the frame -
	carefully pouring clear liquid into an ashtray.  A long
	hypodermic needle slides into the ashtray - the plunger is
	pulled back and the needle quickly fills with liquid. 
	Gingerly, the needle is inserted into the lightbulb.  Again,
	the plunger moves and the lightbulb is filled and placed on a
	table...next to a CAN OF GASOLINE.  VIDEOCAMERA ZOOMS OUT
	revealing...Emil sitting at a hotel desk doing this.

	INT. P.B. HERMAN&#39;S RESTAURANT - DAY

	It&#39;s packed with COPS drinking.  Prosecutors...lawyers...many
	who were at the funeral, including Leon.  All wear the black
	ribbon on their badges.  There&#39;s a quality of an Irish wake -
	boisterous, guys cursing...many cops in uniform.  A buffet
	has been laid out.

	Hawkins enters in a black suit, wearing a black ribbon.  He
	greets people, shaking hands, embracing Leon.

				HAWKINS
		Awful...what an awful day.  He was New
		York City.

	Hawkins notices a young man by the window.  Teary-eyed.  It&#39;s
	Tommy.  Hawkins nods to him.

				TOMMY
		I never got to tell him how much I
		admired him.

				HAWKINS
		I know, son, I know.  We all loved him.

	Hawkins moves on...greeting others.  He notices at the end of
	the bar - sitting alone on a stool - is Nicolette.  He moves
	to her.  Pulls up a stool alongside her.  She turns, looks at
	him.  Just stares at him for a long beat.  She is bombed. 
	Definitely drunk.  She&#39;s had many.  She turns to Hawkins.

				NICOLETTE
		You know...you know he was gonna propose
		to me.  The crime guys found a card he&#39;d
		written out to me.  And a ring
		box...these fuckers that killed him -
		have my ring.  They have my diamond
		engagement ring...

	Hawkins touches her shoulder with compassion.

				HAWKINS
		I know.

				NICOLETTE
		What do you mean you know?  He told you
		he was gonna propose to me?

				HAWKINS
		Well, he...

				NICOLETTE
			(overriding)
		I want to hear everything he said.

				HAWKINS
		I&#39;m trying to tell you.

				NICOLETTE
		Alright.  Go ahead.

				HAWKINS
		That morning.  He was talking to me and
		Leon about marriage.

				NICOLETTE
		Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. 
		He started making overtures - talking
		about little shoes next to his in his
		closet but I got a call to anchor - and
		I walked out on him.  I walked out on
		him when he was trying to ask me to
		marry him!!

	Nicolette is crying now.  She angrily wipes away a tear.

				NICOLETTE (CONT&#39;D)
		I&#39;d never had a great relationship
		before.  I&#39;d never made great choices
		with men.  And he wasn&#39;t easy to get to
		know.  He was older, my parents told me
		I was nuts to get involved with him. 
		But he was so great to me.  Always
		encouraging, telling me I could do
		anything...
			(beat)
		He was the one.  You know, I&#39;d give up
		everything - everything - for just a
		little more time.  I would&#39;ve spent
		fifteen minutes with him if that&#39;s all I
		knew I had.

	She&#39;s lost it.  Hawkins consoles her.  Nicolette shrugs him
	off - turns back to her drink.  Downs the rest of it.  A
	woman arrives, MAGGIE, Hawkins&#39; producer - assistant in tow.

				MAGGIE
		Robert...?

				HAWKINS
		What are you doing here?

				MAGGIE
			(holding a cellular)
		You&#39;ve got a call.

				HAWKINS
		I can&#39;t talk to anybody right now, can&#39;t
		you see I&#39;m busy!  I can&#39;t talk
		business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.
			(to Paulie)
		Get her a whiskey.

				MAGGIE
		Trust me, you&#39;ll want to take this call.

	Robert steps off the stool.  Takes the phone.

				HAWKINS
		Hello?  Who is this?
			(listens)
		How do I know this is you?

	Hawkins gives Nicolette a comforting squeeze on her shoulder. 
	Backs away from the bar.  Now out of hearing distance, he
	looks back at Nicolette and lowers his voice.

				HAWKINS (CONT&#39;D)
		Where?

	We INTERCUT Emil on a public phone in the lobby of a movie
	theater.  Oleg videotapes Emil on the phone, as he throws
	glances into the theater.

				EMIL
		Come to 45 Broadway.  Don&#39;t bring the
		Police.  Come alone or you&#39;ll be in my
		next film.

				HAWKINS
			(low)
		Look asshole.  I&#39;ve been threatened by
		better than you.

				EMIL
		No.  I&#39;m the best that&#39;s ever threatened
		you.

				HAWKINS
		I&#39;ll meet you on one condition - I get
		exclusivity and you surrender to me.

				EMIL
		We&#39;ll talk about that.  Four o&#39;clock
		gives you time to go to bank.  Three
		hundred thousand dollars.

				HAWKINS
		What?  It doesn&#39;t work that way.

				EMIL
			(incensed)
		If you don&#39;t want my film - I&#39;ll call
		another show.  And they will show it.

				HAWKINS
		Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.

				EMIL
		Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we&#39;ll talk
		about surrendering.

	CLICK.  The line goes dead.  Hawkins disconnects.  Hands the
	phone back to Maggie.  She&#39;s looking at him.  Excited. 
	Hawkins looks at Nicolette.  His mind whirls.

	INT. FIRE STATION 91 - KITCHEN - DAY

	Daphne and Korfin are sitting at a table.  Korfin&#39;s arm is in
	a sling, his side bandaged.  Duffy and Jordy enter in their
	dress uniforms.  Korfin walks over to them.

				KORFIN
		How was it?

				JORDY
			(numb)
		Not good.

	Jordy&#39;s quiet.  Dazed.  Nobody can believe Eddie&#39;s gone.

				DUFFY
			(nods to Daphne)
		Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?

				KORFIN
		Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.

				DUFFY
			(to Korfin)
		Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let
		her pick up her clothes and take her
		straight to Hoover Street.  You got
		that?

				KORFIN
		Yeah.

	Jordy looks at her.  Duffy sees them hold each other&#39;s look.

				JORDY
		Chief - mind if I take her?

				DUFFY
		Okay.  But not water sports.

	Duffy walks out.  Jordy leads Daphne out of the station. 
	Korfin follows.  A MAN IN A CHEAP SUIT is talking to Camello
	who points as Jordy walks by.  The man chases after Jordy.

				MAN
		Excuse me - Jordan Warsaw?

				JORDY
		Yeah.

				MAN
			(shoving papers in Jordy&#39;s
			 hand)
		Consider yourself served.

	Jordy opens the papers.  Korfin puts Daphne in the car. 
	Walks back over to Jordy and reads over his shoulder.

				KORFIN
		Zwangendaba??? Is suing you, the
		department and the city of New York for
		10 million?  Who is Zwangendaba?

	Jordy remembers...and gets more depressed.

				JORDY
		The mugger.
						
		EXT. DAPHNE&#39;S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	It&#39;s an old brownstone - in poor condition.  Jordy pulls up. 
	Opens the door for Daphne - takes her by the elbow - steering
	her to the door.  He is edgy.  Jumpy.  Looking around.

				DAPHNE
		Are you alright?

				JORDY
		I still can&#39;t believe Eddie&#39;s gone.

				DAPHNE
		I&#39;m sorry.

	He looks at her.  Nods.  They walk up to the stairs as the
	front door opens.  A NEIGHBOR exits, shocked.  Jordy pulls
	Daphne out of the way.

				DAPHNE (CONT&#39;D)
			(in Czech to the man)
		Hello.  How are you?

	INT. DAPHNE&#39;S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Jordy and Daphne make their way up the stairs.  A bouquet of
	flowers are outside Daphne&#39;s apartment.

				JORDY
		What&#39;s this?

	She takes the card.  Jordy looks over her shoulder.  Daphne
	reads: &quot;Good luck with all your troubles.  I&#39;m here if you
	need me...Ludwig.&quot;

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		Is he your boyfriend?

				DAPHNE
		Ludwig?  He&#39;s gay - are you jealous?

				JORDY
		If I was your boyfriend, I might be.

				DAPHNE
		If you were my boyfriend, I&#39;d suggest
		you find another girlfriend that isn&#39;t
		going to jail ten-thousand miles away.

	They&#39;re staring in each other&#39;s eyes.  The sexual tension
	strong.

				JORDY
		A good Immigration lawyer could stall
		the process.  Eddie recommended one.

				DAPHNE
		No matter what happens...I&#39;m glad I met
		you.

				JORDY
		I&#39;m glad I met you.

	They hold each other&#39;s eyes...then suddenly they kiss. 
	Urgently.  Passionately.  Somebody is coming up the stairs. 
	They part quickly.  A tenant enters his apartment down the
	hall.  Jordy clears his throat.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		Let&#39;s get your stuff.

	He opens the door.  Peers inside - checking it out.  Turns to
	her.  Gestures that it&#39;s okay to enter.

	INT. DAPHNE&#39;S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	It&#39;s very small.  Almost no furniture.  The bare minimum. 
	The apartment is a hole.  She looks at Jordy.  Both thinking
	the same thought.  Another kiss. 

				JORDY
		You better get packed.

				DAPHNE
		Right.

	She holds his look.

				JORDY
		Do you have coffee?

				DAPHNE
		In the kitchen.

				JORDY
		I&#39;ll make some for us.

				DAPHNE
		I&#39;ll get my clothes.

	She heads down the hall.  Jordy enters the small kitchen.  He
	flips on the kitchen light and the LIGHTBULB EXPLODES -
	SETTING THE CEILING ON FIRE AND RELEASING A RAIN OF FIRE INTO
	THE ROOM.  Jordy JUMPS BACK.

				DAPHNE (CONT&#39;D)
		Jordy!!!

				JORDY
		No!  Get back!  GET BACK!!!

	Jordy&#39;s more surprised than shaken.  It&#39;s a fire - he knows
	the drill.  He pushes her into the living room.  Then notices
	a FIRE EXTINGUISHER hanging on the wall.  Grabs it.  Aims it
	at the FIRE spreading in the kitchen.  He SPRAYS as Daphne
	SCREAMS!

				DAPHNE
		That&#39;s not mine!

	WHOOOOOOOOOSH!  The fire extinguisher FEEDS THE FIRE!  Flames
	leap up from the fire - shooting toward the extinguisher
	because it&#39;s filled with gasoline.  The handle LOCKS!  Jordy
	CAN&#39;T TURN IT OFF.  Flames engulf the extinguisher and
	JORDY&#39;S HAND.

	He flings the extinguisher - BACKS OUT OF THE KITCHEN. 
	Closes the door.  Jordy takes off his jacket.  Stuffs it
	under the bottom of the door.  Blocking the smoke.  He
	hurries into the living room.  Knowing it&#39;s moments before
	the extinguisher will explode.  Jordy pulls out his cellular. 
	Hits the speed dial as he notices Daphne about to throw a
	chair through the window.

				JORDY
		Don&#39;t!  It&#39;ll suck the flames toward us!

	Too late.  She SMASHES the window.  There&#39;s an EXPLOSION in
	the kitchen.  Smoke and fire rush down the hallway and along
	the ceiling.  Jordy yells into the phone:

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		This is Jordan Warsaw!  We got a 1075,
		make it quick, we&#39;re trapped!  8th
		Avenue and 44th Street.

	He pulls Daphne toward the bedroom.  It&#39;s locked.  Jordy
	kicks it open.  Grabs the comforter off the bed.  Shoves that
	under the door jam.  He pulls Daphne into the bathroom. 
	Shuts the door.  Runs his severely burned hand under the cold
	water.  Daphne looks out the window - hearing the sirens. 
	She notices someone has nailed the window shut.  And on top
	of one nail...is Eddie&#39;s gold shield.

				DAPHNE
		Oh my G-d!  Oh my G-d!

	Jordy turns - sees Eddie&#39;s shield.

				DAPHNE (CONT&#39;D)
		They were here!

	This freaks her out.  They were in her home.  She starts to
	panic.

				JORDY
		Calm down.  Get a hold of yourself!  Get
		down!

	He pulls aside the curtain to the bathtub.  In it is a CAN OF
	GASOLINE.  A virtual bomb.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		Oh Jesus!

	Daphne reaches for the can of gasoline.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		What are you doing?

				DAPHNE
		Pouring it out!

	She grabs the can of gasoline - pours it down the drain.  The
	FIRE is raging outside the bathroom.  The bathroom door is
	beginning to smoke and burn.  They are trapped.

	Jordy turns - grabs an exposed water pipe that runs up the
	wall to the ceiling.  He throws his feet against the wall for
	leverage.  Pulls with all his might to break it loose.  It&#39;s
	creaking - but he&#39;s having a hard time with it.

				DAPHNE (CONT&#39;D)
		Oh shit!

	Jordy looks over.  The gasoline she&#39;s pouring out - is not
	going down the drain.  It&#39;s stopped up.  As soon as the fire
	gets in the bathroom, everything will explode!

	Jordy begins pulling at the rusty pipe with all his might. 
	Daphne comes over - helps him.  Both of them trying to break
	it off.  Suddenly it snaps and water POURS into the room. 
	SOAKING THE WALLS.  They point the pipe toward the door,
	soaking some of the flames which are consuming the door. 
	Trying to stop the fire from coming in.  He and Daphne are
	drenched.  And trapped.

	Jordy grabs a broken piece of pipe.  Starts SMASHING the wall
	behind them.  The wall to the adjacent apartment.

	VIDEO POV

	Jordy and Daphne in the bathroom - surrounded by fire. 
	CAMERA WHIP PANS down the street as FIRE ENGINES arrive.

	OLEG

	is VIDEOTAPING them from the opposite rooftop.  Tenants from
	Daphne&#39;s building are fleeing down the fire escape.  Emil
	stands in back of Oleg - who is very excited.  He turns the
	camera on himself.

				OLEG
		This is great film!  You can see fire
		right now - Daphne is in fire - Fire
		Marshal is here.  Everything is so
		messy.  Everything is so crazy right
		here!  Look at this fire!  We made it! 
		90% of people who die in fire die from
		eating smoke.  So most likely they all
		die from eating smoke.

	The CAMERA PANS to Emil.

				OLEG (CONT&#39;D)
		And this is the man who started the
		fire.  Say something to your fans, Emil!

	Emil waits a beat and then blows a kiss to the lens.

	DAPHNE&#39;S BATHROOM

	Filled with smoke.  You can barely see Jordy or Daphne. 
	Jordy SMASHES a hole in the wall - which reveals the bathroom
	in the apartment next door.  The smoke has a place to escape. 
	There&#39;s a 7-year old KID in there.  Standing in the bathroom. 
	Terrified.

				JORDY
		Get back!  Get out of the bathroom! 
		Run!

				7-YEAR OLD KID
		The hallway is on fire!

				JORDY
		It&#39;s okay.  I&#39;m a fireman.  I&#39;m going to
		help you.  Get back!  Now!

	Jordy pushes Daphne through the wall - turns as the bathroom
	door catches fire.  It&#39;s seconds before the whole room will
	blow up.

	OLEG

	Across the roof is videotaping the bathroom as it EXPLODES!

	EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

	Fire engines have arrived.  The street is filled with
	gawkers.  Garcia and Korfin pull up just as Jordy runs from
	the building - holding the kid in one arm and pulling Daphne
	with the other.  Carefully guarding his bandaged hand.  A
	fireman grabs the kid.  Another grabs Daphne.  Garcia and
	Korfin run to Jordy.

				GARCIA
		Jordy!  What the hell happened?!

				KORFIN
		Are you alright, man?  Lemme see the
		hand!

				JORDY
		Where&#39;s Daphne?  Daphne?

	He spots Daphne on the corner as a familiar voice pushes
	through the crowd.

				VOICE
		Isn&#39;t she a beauty?  She&#39;s my fire, look
		at that loom-up on her!

	Jordy turns - it&#39;s Max.  The attention pyromaniac who Jordy
	threw out of his office.  As a news crew arrives, Max turns
	to the cameras.

				MAX
		I did this!  I did this!  Take my
		picture!  I&#39;m Max!  Max Gornick!

	Jordy grabs Max - pushes him away.

				JORDY
		Get outta here!

				KORFIN
		What the hell happened?

				JORDY
		They were inside.  They booby trapped
		her apartment!

	Korfin scans the crowd.  Looking for Emil and Oleg.  In the
	b.g., Duffy is SCREAMING.

				DUFFY
		What the hell are you talking about??? 
		They&#39;re gonna do what?

	Jordy and Korfin turn.  The Chief has a phone to his ear and
	is freaked.

	INT. LOBBY OF CHANNEL 12 BROADCASTING - NIGHT

	JORDY&#39;S POV

	as he enters the TV station.  His clothes burnt and still
	wet.  The lobby&#39;s full of ANGRY COPS.  Tommy and Leon, still
	in his funeral suit, SCREAMING above them all at Maggie the
	producer and her ASSISTANT, who are standing behind the desk.

				TOMMY
		Where is he?!  Where is Hawkins?!

				MAGGIE
		He&#39;s not on the premises!

				LEON
		I want the tape.  Go get it and bring it
		here this minute.

				MAGGIE
		Any request for the video must be
		directed to &quot;Top Story&#39;s&quot; attorney -
		Bruce Cutler.  I&#39;ll be happy to give you
		his number.

	Leon jumps over the desk where Maggie stands.  Tommy pushes
	past the security guard to follow Leon.  They continue toward
	Maggie, pushing her further back into the office.  She tries
	to protect herself with an office door which Leon slams open.

				LEON
		Lady, if you put Eddie&#39;s murder on TV,
		I&#39;ll get a warrant for your arrest and
		shove it so far up your ass it&#39;ll come
		outta your mouth!

				MAGGIE
		I want your shield number!

				HAWKINS (O.S.)
		Viewer discretion advised!

				MAGGIE
			(pointing at the TV)
		You want the tape?  There it is!

	Leon, Tommy, all the cops and Jordy - turn toward a TV set
	which is mounted in the lobby.  The &quot;Top Story&quot; logo flashes
	on the screen, then Robert Hawkins is seen behind his desk.

				HAWKINS
		What we are about to broadcast is very
		graphic footage...

	Everyone is riveted.  But Jordy notices outside...a &quot;Top
	Story&quot; NEWS VAN is waiting in the alley.  Robert Hawkins
	jumps from a doorway and into the van.  Jordy backs out.

	INT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - NIGHT

	POP...a video POV of a bottle of Crystal as the cork is
	popped.  The videocamera pans up to Emil sitting at the
	table.  He nods at the waiter who leaves.  Emil raises the
	glass - looking into the lens.

				EMIL
		America!  Who says you can&#39;t be success
		in America?  I arrived with nothing,
		knowing nobody - now look - I am a
		success story!

	The videocamera is lowered.  Oleg turns it off.  Asks
	suspiciously.

				OLEG
		You are success story?  I am success
		story!  Why do you say I and not we?

				EMIL
		Oleg, don&#39;t be paranoid.  You got a
		hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn&#39;t
		you?  I gave you half of what they gave
		me.  Look - here we are!

	Emil gestures toward the big television set.  We are in
	Planet Hollywood - where diners and those by the bar can
	watch a huge screen hanging from the ceiling.  Robert Hawkins
	is introducing his show.

				HAWKINS (ON T.V.)
		Good evening.  Welcome to &quot;Top Story&quot;. 
		Tonight, I present to you material of a
		graphic and violent nature never before
		seen on television.  And I do so with a
		heavy heart.  You will be first-hand
		witness to the slaying of celebrated New
		York City Homicide Detective, Eddie
		Flemming.  It would be only normal to
		ask, why?  Why are we showing something
		so journalist, I must show it.  A
		democracy survives through the freedom
		of its media, and if we cannot see what
		is happening then we don&#39;t deserve our
		democracy, or our freedom.  Eddie
		Flemming was my friend.  I cried when I
		watched this footage and vowed to fight
		this violence with every molecule of my
		being from this day onward.  Hopefully,
		this will have a similar effect on you. 
		One final word, this material is
		absolutely not appropriate for children.

	The restaurant BUZZES.  Emil checks his watch.

				OLEG
		In movie they make of us, who do you
		think would act me?

				EMIL
		The one who got caught in the bathroom.
			(beat)
		George Michael.

	Emil laughs.  Oleg doesn&#39;t.

				OLEG
		I&#39;m serious.

				EMIL
		Shut up.  Look!

	Emil points towards the TV.  &quot;Top Story&quot; is continuing.  The
	scene cuts to Emil&#39;s video footage.  Eddie is handcuffed to
	the chair.  The light illuminating his face.

				OLEG (O.S.)
		This is my project.  I say &#39;action.&#39;  I
		am the director!  You are the talent. 
		You wait for me to say &#39;action.&#39;
			(beat)
		And &#39;action!&#39;

				EMIL
		Bad last moment - I cut it out.

	Emil looks at Oleg - furious.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		I told you to cut that out before we
		handed in the tape!

				OLEG
		Be quiet.  Watch.

	Oleg watches the big-screen TV as Emil raises the pistol to
	Eddie&#39;s temple.  Eddie pushes him over the desk.  Eddie then
	knocks Emil with the chair and Emil falls off the desk onto
	the floor.  Eddie continues around with the chair and drives
	Oleg back across the room - pinning him to the wall.  Eddie
	and Emil both go for the gun.  Eddie knocks him out of the
	way.  Stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly. 
	Leaves him in a ball on the floor.  Oleg comes at Eddie and
	he knocks Oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa.  The
	blinds and lamp shade are shot - bathing the room with more
	light.  Emil stabs Eddie in the stomach.  Oleg kneels down
	for a CLOSE-UP.

				EMIL
		Die.  Die.

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

	Hawkins&#39; van drives across Times Square.  Jordy&#39;s car
	following.  We WIDEN OUT... Eddie&#39;s murder is being broadcast
	on the JUMBOTRON in Times Square.  People stare up - stunned.

	INT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - CONTINUOUS

	The dinner patrons are watching TV.  Shocked.  Emil glares at
	Oleg.

				EMIL
		Why did you leave that stuff in about
		you being the director?

				OLEG
		Because I am the director.  Don&#39;t you
		realize, if it wasn&#39;t for my film, for
		my talent, my idea to do this - no way
		would we be sitting here right now.

				EMIL
		Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.

	Oleg tenses.  Emil laughs.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		Aren&#39;t you just the cameraman?

	Oleg doesn&#39;t laugh.

				OLEG
		I&#39;m serious...this - this is a great
		American film.  Full of violence and
		sex.  And I want my credit.

				EMIL
		Credit?

				OLEG
		Yes.  Before we hand in the next video -
		I put titles on it and my credit is
		going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.

				EMIL
		Yes.  But there&#39;s only one problem - you
		want credit but the problem is - I don&#39;t
		share credit.

	Oleg is pissed.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		You got that?

				OLEG
		No, I don&#39;t get that!

				EMIL
		You think you are a director?  You are a
		fucking little, small Russian piece of
		shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate
		you.

	Emil slaps Oleg across the face.  Oleg stands up.  Emil
	suddenly pulls out Eddie&#39;s gun but before he can pull the
	trigger, Oleg STABS Emil in the arm!  Emil squeezes off a
	shot through the crowded restaurant.  Patrons SCREAM - Oleg
	runs through the restaurant, escaping.  It&#39;s chaos. 
	Hawkins arrives with a crew and with BRUCE CUTLER, a
	confident, tough criminal attorney.

	Emil pulls the steak knife out of his arm, picks up a napkin -
	pressing it to his wound.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		Oh, hello.

	Cutler accesses the situation.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		Are you my attorney?
			(extends his hand to Cutler)
		I&#39;m Emil.  I&#39;m insane.

				CUTLER
		I&#39;m not your lawyer until I see the
		money.

				EMIL
		Here.  I have your money.

	Emil picks up a briefcase and hands it to Cutler.  Cutler
	opens it - inside is the cash Emil got from Robert Hawkins. 
	Emil looks at the table, pushing the plates and silverware
	aside.  Emil looks under the table, throwing the chair aside,
	freaking.  He&#39;s lost the most important thing in his life.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		Oh no!  No!  Shit!

				CUTLER
			(follows Emil - reaching out to
			 him)
		Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit
		down.  What do you need?  What are you
		looking for?

				EMIL
		He has the camera!  He took the movie!

	Jordy comes in, gun raised.

				JORDY
		Don&#39;t move!  Don&#39;t move!  Get your hands
		up!  Drop it!

	Emil puts his hands in the air.  Immediately drops the gun!

				EMIL
		I give up!

	Jordy is disappointed!  He didn&#39;t want to take Emil alive. 
	Hawkins signals to his camera man, who swings his camera at
	Jordy as he approaches Emil, his gun aimed at Emil&#39;s head.

				CUTLER
		This man is unarmed, officer.  He&#39;s
		surrendered.

	Jordy cracks Emil across the face - knocking him down.

				CUTLER (CONT&#39;D)
		What are you hitting him for?

				JORDY
		Turn that camera off!

	Jordy handcuffs him.  Emil turns to the camera for sympathy,
	appearing more hurt than he is.

				EMIL
		No.  Keep filming...

	Jordy realizes how media savvy Emil is and understands in
	that moment why he&#39;s surrendering.  Jordy yanks Emil up -
	dragging him across the restaurant floor - Emil still
	favoring his ankle.

				CUTLER
			(to Emil)
		Don&#39;t say anything.

				EMIL
		Where are we going?

				CUTLER
		I&#39;m coming with you.

				EMIL
		Yes.  Yes, come with me!

				CUTLER
			(to Jordy)
		I&#39;m invoking rights - this man is
		represented by counsel.  I&#39;m coming with
		him.

	The &quot;Top Story&quot; crew is all over them, filming everything. 
	Cutler stays close to Emil.  Making sure he&#39;s in the video
	footage.

				JORDY
		Turn that camera off!

	EXT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - CONTINUOUS

	As Jordy comes out with a limping Emil, police are arriving. 
	Tommy, Leon and Murphy run over as Jordy opens the back door
	to his car.  Leon grabs Emil.

				LEON
		I&#39;ll take him.

				JORDY
		No way!  He&#39;s mine!

				LEON
			(holding on to Emil, squeezing
			 his arm hard)
		We&#39;re takin&#39; him.  Don&#39;t argue!

				JORDY
		He&#39;s my collar!

				LEON
		Well, he killed my partner!

				JORDY
		He&#39;s yours but I take him in!  I&#39;ll
		drive him to the precinct, you can have
		him but I&#39;m walkin&#39; him in.

	Leon realizes Jordy wants to be seen on TV taking Emil into
	custody.

				LEON
		Okay, kid, have your 15-minutes.  I&#39;ll
		follow you.  Tommy, you ride with him!

	Leon stares hatefully into Emil&#39;s eyes.

				LEON (CONT&#39;D)
		You&#39;re goin&#39; down, motherfucker, you are
		goin&#39; down.  I&#39;ll be there with a smile
		when they put you down!

	Cutler hurries to Emil&#39;s side.

				CUTLER
		Don&#39;t say a word.  Don&#39;t respond to his
		taunting!
			(to Leon)
		He&#39;s represented by counsel.  You want
		to speak to someone - you speak to me!

				TOMMY
		Out of the way, counselor.

	Tommy shoves Cutler aside.

				CUTLER
		Don&#39;t you put your hands on me,
		Detective.

	Jordy pushes Emil in the back seat and slams the door.  Leon
	turns to Hawkins, whose cameras are filming everything.

				LEON
		And you, you&#39;ll pay for what you did!

				HAWKINS
			(low)
		This footage will work in your favor. 
		When the jury sees this - no matter what
		Cutler tries, they&#39;ll convict him.

	Leon looks at him. This man used to be his friend.

				LEON
		You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of
		yourself.

				HAWKINS
		If I didn&#39;t put it on somebody else
		would!  I was his friend!

				LEON
		Don&#39;t give me that fucking shit.

	The cameras are rolling.

				MURPHY
		Don&#39;t get into it on TV.

				LEON
			(yells to other cop cars)
		Alright, let&#39;s get going!

	Leon and the other cops rush to their cars.  Jordy is already
	behind the wheel.  As soon as Tommy jumps in the passenger
	seat, Jordy takes off.  The cameras film him driving away.
		
	INT. JORDY&#39;S CAR - NIGHT

	Jordy takes a left turn, racing away.  Running all the
	lights.

				TOMMY
		What are you doin&#39;?  You&#39;re gonna lose
		everybody!

	Jordy rips through another turn, heading toward the West Side
	Highway.  The car speeds up the ramp and races up the left
	lane - having lost the police.

				TOMMY (CONT&#39;D)
		Where are you goin&#39;??  This ain&#39;t the
		way to the station!

	Jordy looks up at Emil in the rear view mirror.

	EXT. WEST SIDE HIGHWAY EXIT - CONTINUOUS

	Jordy pulls off on 130th Street.  They are way uptown in the
	middle of nowhere.  The car drives down a dark street.  
	Crumbled, vacant buildings dominate the streets and there are
	no people around.

	EXT. DESERTED STREET - CONTINUOUS

	The car slows down.  Tommy watches Jordy, realizes what&#39;s
	going on.  Jordy stops at a dead end.  Pulls open the back
	door, yanks Emil out and starts to drag him up into the
	deserted tunnel.

				TOMMY
		Jordy...??? Listen to me.  You can&#39;t do
		this.  This isn&#39;t the way to do things.

	Jordy ignores Tommy, slamming him up against the tunnel wall.

				JORDY
		Were you a fireman?  That how you knew
		how to rig the apartment?

				EMIL
		My father was.  He gave me many lessons
		about fire.  Now it&#39;s my friend.

				JORDY
		Tommy, take a walk.

				TOMMY
		What are you gonna do?

				JORDY
		Don&#39;t you get it?  He knew he was gonna
		get caught!  That&#39;s why he videotaped
		Eddie&#39;s murder - he thinks he&#39;s gonna
		get off.

				TOMMY
		Don&#39;t stoop to his level!

	Jordy tosses the car keys to Tommy.

				JORDY
		Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.

				TOMMY
		Look, you can&#39;t shoot him in cold blood.

				JORDY
			(erupting)
		GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR
		AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I&#39;LL
		KILL YOU, TOO!!!

	Tommy nervously backs up toward Jordy&#39;s car.  Climbs behind
	the wheel and drives away, leaving Jordy and Emil alone in
	the darkness.  Jordy takes out Eddie&#39;s pistol.  The one Emil
	took from Eddie.  Jordy opens the cylinder - two bullets
	left.  Jordy snaps the cylinder shut, tucks Eddie&#39;s gun in
	Emil&#39;s belt.  He drags Emil away from the wall, into the
	center of the empty space - unlocks Emil&#39;s handcuffs and
	throws them aside.  Still holding the gun on Emil, he circles
	around to face him.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		Get your hands up!  Get your hands up!

	Now facing Emil, he sticks his gun in his waistband - the
	same place he put Emil&#39;s.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		You wanna be a real American?  Go for
		your gun.

	Emil holds his arms out - making it clear he&#39;s not going for
	the gun.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		Pull the gun!  You want to be famous? 
		Shoot me, you&#39;ll get more headlines and
		make more money.

	Emil watches Jordy...a slow grin spreads across his face.

				EMIL
		You can&#39;t kill me.  You&#39;re not a cop. 
		Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you
		never shot anybody in your life.

				JORDY
		You&#39;ll be my first.

	Jordy pulls out his 9mm and pushes the barrel right between
	Emil&#39;s eyes.

				EMIL
		C&#39;mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh,
		look, you&#39;re sweating.  You don&#39;t have
		the balls.

				JORDY
		Get down on your knees.

	Emil gets on his knees and starts to sing in Czech.  SIRENS
	fill the air.  Police cars come flying down the street.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		Where&#39;s your partner?

				EMIL
		The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. 
		Go get Oleg.  He&#39;ll kill you.

	Leon runs up.  Tommy&#39;s relieved to see Jordy didn&#39;t kill
	Emil.

				LEON
		Gimme your gun, Jordy.  We all want him
		dead but you can&#39;t do it this way.

	Emil is still smiling.  Jordy suddenly slams Emil in the
	face.  Knocking him to the floor.  He jumps in his car and
	speeds away.
		
		INT. BROADWAY SHERATON - 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

	A room service WAITER wheels a tray with a magnum bottle of
	Crystal, with three glasses, toward Oleg&#39;s room.  Jordy
	follows behind him - gun aimed at his back.

				WAITER
		Do you really need me?

				JORDY
		Keep your mouth shut.  Don&#39;t mess this
		up.

	They reach the room.  Jordy flattens himself against the
	wall.  The waiter KNOCKS.

				HOOKER&#39;S VOICE
		Who&#39;s there?

				WAITER
			(nervous)
		R-room service.

	A HOOKER, wrapped in a towel, opens the door a crack, looking
	out at the waiter.

				HOOKER
		Come in.

	Jordy whips around the corner - pointing his gun and pushing
	the hooker back out of the room.  Jordy moves to the bedroom
	door.  Peers through the crack.  Oleg sits on the edge of the
	bed in his skivvies with two naked prostitutes.  He&#39;s hooked
	up his videocamera to the TV set and is showing them his
	footage of the fire.

				OLEG
		Look at that.  See that shot!  Seamless. 
		No cuts.
			(excited)
		And look.  Look at that transition. 
		That&#39;s filmmaking!!  Isn&#39;t it great?!

	Jordy KICKS in the door - gun raised.

				JORDY
		Don&#39;t move!

	Oleg grabs the videocamera.  Has on hooker in a head lock and
	picks up the other one.  He rushes at Jordy - using one of
	the hookers for protection.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		Drop the girl!  Drop her!!

	Oleg pushes the hookers at Jordy - knocking Jordy back into
	the living room and over the back of the sofa.  Oleg rushes
	out into the

	HOTEL HALLWAY

	Oleg runs to the fire exit - Jordy follows, chasing Oleg down
	the stairwell.

	EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT

	Oleg bursts out a door which opens onto Broadway.  He runs
	through the crowd - knocking pedestrians aside!  Jordy chases
	him, gun in hand!

	Oleg runs into the street, darting in and out of traffic,
	cars braking to a stop.  One SLAMS into another. 
	Jordy leaps over a car, closing in on Oleg.  People gawk. 
	Even in New York, it&#39;s odd to see a man being chased in his
	underwear.  Oleg runs, knocking people aside.  He&#39;s holding
	the camera in his hand.  It&#39;s on.

				JORDY
		STOP!  STOP THAT MAN!

	A UNIFORMED COP turns as Oleg runs right into him.  Knocking
	him down.  Oleg beats him, takes his gun and runs into:

	INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

	Oleg, gun in hand, runs past the TICKET TAKER at the door.

				TICKET TAKER
		Hey, come back here!

	The ticket taker runs after Oleg who continues past the candy
	counter.  Jordy rushes in the door.

				JORDY
		Where is he?  Where&#39;d he go?

				TICKET TAKER
		Middle door.

	Jordy continues running through the lobby - past the middle
	door - and enters the theater through the far door.

	INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

	Jordy enters the theater, crouches down in the aisle.  It&#39;s a
	night scene, the theater is dark.  Jordy tries to see faces. 
	He cuts through a row of seats to the middle aisle.

				DRUNK&#39;S VOICE
		Kill him!  Kill the bastard!

	Jordy spins toward the voice - it&#39;s a DRUNK.  Others start
	YELLING for blood!

				AUDIENCE
		Shoot him!  SHOOT!

	A GUNSHOT!  Jordy ducks!  Another GUNSHOT!  Jordy realizes
	the shots are coming from the screen.

				OLEG
		Look!  Over here!

	Jordy turns.  Oleg stands up and FIRES at him - trying to
	film Jordy&#39;s death with a videocamera. 
	Jordy ducks, then rises up with his gun as Oleg vaults over
	the seats, leaping from one to the other, mashing shoulders
	and heads, bounding for the screen.

				JORDY
		Everybody down!  Stay DOWN!

	Jordy FIRES as the screen villain blasts away.  Some in the
	audience don&#39;t realize the real thing is happening.  Oleg
	leaps on the stage in front of the screen, illuminated by it. 
	Jordy runs down the aisle.  Oleg FIRES at Jordy.  Jordy FIRES
	back.  People panic - scurrying away - Jordy can&#39;t get a
	clear shot.  Oleg FIRES again, wounding a moviegoer.  Jordy
	raises up as the theater lights go on...and Oleg is gone! 
	Jordy jumps on the stage - runs backstage - Oleg has
	disappeared.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		Shit!

	SIRENS are heard from outside.  VOICES of cops are heard as
	they enter.

	CLOSE ON TV

	A REPORTER is in Times Square, reports from outside the movie
	theater.

				REPORTER (ON T.V.)
		...and the wild chase through Times
		Square ended with the suspect, Oleg
		Razgul, escaping.  The fire department
		has identified the fire marshal involved
		in the failed pursuit as Jordy Warsaw.

	The channel is changed.  PETER ARNETT is reporting the same
	story.

				PETER ARNETT (ON T.V.)
		In a related matter, Mr. Slovak&#39;s
		attorney, Bruce Cutler - famous for
		handling sensational cases - claims his
		client is unfit to stand trial.

	INT. JAIL CELL - WIDER - DAY

	Daphne sitting on a bench in a jail cell.  Watching TV
	through the bars.  She is in the fire department&#39;s holding
	cell in Brooklyn.

				PETER ARNETT (ON T.V.)
		In fact, Cutler claimed Mr. Slovak was
		not the alleged mastermind behind the
		murders. 
		According to Cutler, Mr. Slovak was
		being directed by his partner, who
		threatened to kill him if he didn&#39;t
		follow Mr. Razgul&#39;s orders.  Cutler told
		reporters today that Mr. Razgul did in
		fact stab his client.

	The scene CUTS TO Cutler&#39;s press conference.

				CUTLER
		My client, Mr. Slovak, is a victim. 
		What&#39;s happened is not his fault.  Emil
		was under the influence of his partner. 
		At the trial, you&#39;ll see that my client
		will be vindicated...

	INT. BELLEVUE - MENTAL OBSERVATION UNIT - DAY

	The CAMERA WIDENS from the TV set.  We are now in an
	interview room, a guard is posted outside the room.  Emil
	sits at a small table - with Cutler.  Emil is dressed in
	Bellevue clothes.  He&#39;s handcuffed and his ankle is bandaged. 
	Emil gives a complimentary nod toward Cutler.

				CUTLER
		I brought you some letters.  It&#39;s really
		fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to
		buy you clothes, another sent a check. 
		Another wants a check.

				EMIL
		You bring the cigarettes?

				CUTLER
		Oh, sure.

	Cutler shakes a cigarette out of the pack, stuffs it in
	Emil&#39;s mouth and lights it for him.  Emil has never smoked
	before.

				CUTLER (CONT&#39;D)
		How&#39;re they treating you, alright
			(Emil is nonresponsive)
		I want to get the cuffs off... but
		there&#39;s a little bit of a problem. 
		Things out there are very negative right
		now for us.  We gotta change that
		around.  Perception is very, very
		important.  Perception is reality.  I
		know you&#39;re not fuckin&#39; crazy.  But it&#39;s
		important that I get that message out. 
		Cause that&#39;s our only defense in this
		case.

	Emil leans forward.  Cutler retrieves the cigarette from
	between his lips.

				CUTLER (CONT&#39;D)
		I want you to focus on three things:
		fear...

	He puts the cigarette back in Emil&#39;s mouth.

				CUTLER (CONT&#39;D)
		...delusions and paranoia.

				EMIL
		I was all of these.

				CUTLER
		Well, you didn&#39;t appreciate the severity
		of it until recently.  No question about
		that.

				EMIL
		What about Oleg?

				CUTLER
		Disappeared.  They&#39;re looking
		everywhere.  Maybe he went back to
		Czechoslovakia.

				EMIL
		No, he is here.  Shit...

				CUTLER
		Don&#39;t worry about him.  Think about
		yourself.

				EMIL
		What about my movie rights?  Book
		rights?

				CUTLER
		Look, I haven&#39;t really focused on that
		kind of thing.

				EMIL
		What&#39;s your cut?  How much?

				CUTLER
		I would say...half.  Half is fair.

				EMIL
			(laughs)
		No.  No way.

				CUTLER
		But it&#39;s...

				EMIL
		Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call
		another lawyer.  This is the biggest
		case of your life.  Don&#39;t try to
		negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or
		no.

				CUTLER
		This is not about money, Emil.  I need
		your trust in me.

				EMIL
		What else do you need?

				CUTLER
		I need to know about your background.  I
		need to know about your upbringing.  Why
		you&#39;re here.

				EMIL
			(indicating cigarette)
		Give me another one, please.

	Cutler stuffs another cigarette in Emil&#39;s mouth.  Lights it.

				CUTLER
		Tell me about yourself.  What you did as
		a young boy... what your parents were
		like.

				EMIL
		My father always degraded me.  Killed my
		self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.

				CUTLER
		Your mother was blind?

				EMIL
		Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. 
		She went to fucking black market doctor
		to induce me.

				CUTLER
		Back in the Czech Republic?

				EMIL
		Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad
		drugs which made her go blind.  And my
		father blamed me for her blindness...

				CUTLER
		Your father blamed you for your mother&#39;s
		blindness?

				EMIL
		Yeah, he hated me from day when I was
		born.  Put it out.  Can you put the
		cigarette out?

	Cutler takes the cigarette from Emil&#39;s lips and extinguishes
	it.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		That&#39;s what he did to me.  He put
		cigarettes out on me.

				CUTLER
		Your father put cigarettes out on you?

				EMIL
		Out on my back when I was a small boy.

				CUTLER
		Can I see your back?

	Emil rises.  Cutler comes around and pulls his shirt up.  HIS
	ENTIRE BACK IS COVERED WITH DISGUSTING PURPLISH WELTS FROM
	CIGARETTE BURNS.  Cutler recoils - horrified.

				CUTLER (CONT&#39;D)
		Oh, Jesus.

				EMIL
		I&#39;m abused.  Don&#39;t you think?

				CUTLER
		I don&#39;t think it&#39;s abuse, I think it&#39;s
		torture.

	INT. FIRE STATION 91 - DUFFY&#39;S OFFICE - DAY

	Inside the Arson Squad, Duffy sits behind his desk.  Jordy
	stands across the table from his Chief.  Behind Jordy we can
	see Garcia and Korfin outside, listening.  Duffy has a
	subpoena in his hand.

				DUFFY
		The public doesn&#39;t have any idea what we
		do and now you&#39;re going to define our
		image!  This is going to be our Rodney
		King!

				JORDY
		What was I supposed to do?  The guy
		tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop
		back - I just forgot.

				DUFFY
		Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a
		tree?!

				JORDY
		Chief - I know I screwed up - but this
		guy was no innocent civilian.

				DUFFY
		Well this is gonna end your career and
		probably mine.

				JORDY
		End my career?

				DUFFY
		How are you going to fight this?  Maybe
		if Oleg hadn&#39;t gotten away and you&#39;d
		been on the front page, as a hero, this
		thing would be easier to fight.  You&#39;d
		have the good to weight against the bad! 
		It&#39;s unfortunate that I have to make
		decisions based upon your press coverage
		but there&#39;s nothing I can do!  Gimme
		your shield.

				JORDY
		But Chief?  Over this??

				DUFFY
		There&#39;s nothing to talk about.  Get a
		good lawyer.  You&#39;re suspended until
		your trial.

	Jordy sighs.  Dying inside.  He surrenders his shield.  Drops
	his handcuffs, his pager and his gun.  Duffy picks up the gun
	- looks at it.

				DUFFY (CONT&#39;D)
			(pats Jordy&#39;s shoulder)
		I know you got backup at home.  Drop it
		off.

	Jordy sighs and exits.

	INT. IMMIGRATION &amp; NATURALIZATION OFFICE - DAY

	Jordy is talking to BILL STERN, a senior special agent.  In
	another office we see Daphne with two 25-year old ASSISTANT
	U.S. ATTORNEYS.

				STERN
			(to Jordy)
		Look, what don&#39;t you understand?  We&#39;ve
		got a good relationship with the Czech&#39;s
		and the State Department doesn&#39;t want to
		cause an incident.

				JORDY
		But the D.A. needs her as an eyewitness!

				STERN
		They&#39;ve got her testimony on videotape. 
		And even if they do take her to court
		immediately after she&#39;ll be extradited. 
		The Czechs want her back.  She shot a
		cop!  I mean, Christ, man, what if Emil
		Slovak and Oleg Razgul fled to the Czech
		Republic?  How would you feel if the
		Czechs wouldn&#39;t give them back to us?!

	Stern looks over at Daphne sitting in another office.  Lowers
	his voice.

				STERN (CONT&#39;D)
		And just between us...I was married to a
		redhead.  They&#39;re a jinx.  Redheads are
		like cross-eyed priests.  Stay away from
		both.

	Jordy gives him a look.

				STERN (CONT&#39;D)
		You want to see her - go ahead.

	Jordy enters the other office.  Sits next to Daphne.  The
	assistant U.S. Attorneys leave.

				JORDY
		We&#39;re gonna fight the extradition.

	Daphne takes Jordy&#39;s bandaged hand in hers.

				DAPHNE
		Forget about me.  You have enough
		problems of your own.

				JORDY
		...Do you really want me to forget about
		you?

				DAPHNE
		I don&#39;t want to drag you down with me.

				JORDY
		Daphne, I...

	Daphne touches her finger to his lips.

				DAPHNE
		Shhhh.

	She leans in and kisses him.  Then looks into his eyes,
	trying to find a smile.

	EXT. FEDERAL COURT HOUSE STEPS - DAY

	It&#39;s weeks later.  Nicolette is looking worn, tired,
	frazzled.  She&#39;s trying to go through her stand up.  But
	she&#39;s unraveling.  Not recovered from the loss of Eddie.

				NICOLETTE 
		...and today with his partner who he
		blamed for the crimes still at large,
		Emil Slovak will appear in court.  His
		lawyer will argue that he is mentally 
		unfit to stand trial.  Eyewitness News
		has also learned that later this month,
		Jordy Warsaw will himself be appearing
		in court.  He will be arraigned on
		charges of violating the civil rights
		of...Zwangen...Zwagen...

				MIKE
		Zwangendaba.

				NICOLETTE
		Goddamn assholes everywhere. 
		Zwangenbobby..Zwangendaba.  I got it. 
		I&#39;ll do it.  Shit.  Let&#39;s start again. 
		5-4-3-2-1...

	She starts over.

	INT. JORDY&#39;S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Jordy&#39;s on the couch.  A drink in his hand, watching TV with
	his dog, ZACK.  Jordy&#39;s eyes are glazed.  He&#39;s drunk, his
	eyes are as bloodshot as Eddie&#39;s were...without his job or
	Daphne. 
	His mind miles away - the dog and drink are his only comfort. 
	As Nicolette reports (she got the name right), her anger
	seeps through her broadcast.

				NICOLETTE (ON T.V.)
		Mr. Zwangendaba claims to be a direct
		descendent of the African King from whom
		he takes his name...

	Jordy&#39;s face is flashed on screen.  The phone RINGS.  Jordy
	picks up.

				JORDY
		Hello?
			(listens)
		No comment.

	He hangs up.  The phone RINGS AGAIN.

				JORDY (CONT&#39;D)
		Hello?
			(listens)
		No!

	Jordy hangs up.  Changes the channel.  He stops as Robert
	Hawkins&#39; face fills the screen.  He is standing across from
	someone - in a park - interviewing him.

				HAWKINS (ON T.V.)
		He robbed you?

	The ANGLE CUTS to Zwangendaba, the mugger, now dressed in a
	suit and tie.  Clean shaven and with a fresh haircut.  He
	stands in the same spot where Jordy handcuffed him to the
	tree.  He&#39;s appearing on &quot;Top Story&quot;.

				ZWANGENDABA (ON T.V.)
		That&#39;s right, I encountered him right
		here.  I was just askin&#39; for change an&#39;
		he whips out his big gun an&#39; pushes me
		up against that tree, whereupon he takes
		my money and handcuffs me to it, leavin&#39;
		me there all exposed...

	The phone RINGS again.  Jordy suddenly pulls the phone off
	the table and throws it through the window:

	BACK TO TV

	as the channel is changed.  A REPORTER is on TV.  Behind him
	is a picture of Emil.  Emil is smiling, in a shirt and tie. 
	The reporter stands in front of the jail.

				REPORTER
		...and WBAI has learned that Mr. Slovak
		won&#39;t have to worry about how he is
		going to pay for his defense.  He has
		received movie offers and been in
		conversations with numerous publishers
		concerning the rights to his life story.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	Oleg is at a bar watching TV.  Poisoned with envy.


	INT. JORDY&#39;S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

	Jordy stands in front of the mirror over the dresser.  We see
	the TV overturned in the b.g.  His back up gun is on it.  He
	stares at it.  Dark thoughts dancing in his head.

	EXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY

	Jordy sits in a taxi, wearing sunglasses.  Looking inside the
	park where a POLICE BARRICADE surrounds a POLICE TUGBOAT. 
	Cutler and Emil are arriving - Emil is being transferred to
	Rykers Island.  Jordy pulls his .38 out of his ankle holster
	and sticks it in his pocket.

	CLOSE ON METER

	to $42.00.  The TAXI DRIVER looks in the rearview mirror.

				TAXI DRIVER
		I can&#39;t believe this guy got off. 
		Unbelievable.

	Jordy takes out money.  All he&#39;s got is fifty bucks and he
	crams it into the slot.

				JORDY
		Whatever&#39;s leftover, keep.

	Jordy exits the cab.  The anger rising inside his body is
	coming to a boiling point.  He walks into the park.  Leon is
	sitting on a bench.  Just sitting there.  Also filled with
	rage and frustration.  Jordy meets his eyes.  Leon gets up
	and walks away.  Disgusted by it all.  Jordy&#39;s right hand
	grips the gun inside his pocket as he walks on.

	HIGH WIDE SHOT

	Many policemen are trying to control a swarm of reporters. 
	All are waiting for Emil.  WE SEE:

	HAWKINS

	and his camera crew, and, not far from him - frustrated and
	frazzled, waits Nicolette.  Still grieving her loss, she
	looks over at Hawkins and his crew.  She shoots him a
	disgusted look - Hawkins shrugs it off.  He checks his watch -
	anxious - looks at his cameraman.

				HAWKINS
		He said he&#39;d be here.  Pick him up as he
		comes through the crowd.  Do you hear
		me?  For Chrissakes don&#39;t miss this.

	THE POLICE VAN PULLS UP

	Cutler&#39;s car behind it.  Emil - handcuffed - is unloaded from
	the van.  Reporters swarm forward - Cutler gets out of his
	car, hurrying up, taking his place alongside Emil and the
	POLICE ESCORTS.  The swarm follows - firing questions at
	Cutler.  He answers the barrage of questions with:

				CUTLER
		...my client was suffering from a major
		illness of schizophrenic nature wherein
		during times of intense stress, as a
		result of paranoid and psychotic
		delusions - there was impairment of his
		ability to appreciate wrongfullness...
		This is a victory for the mentally ill!

	Jordy walks alongside the moving mass.  His eyes focused on
	Emil - his hand in his pocket.  We notice in the crowd Max,
	the celebrity-crazed pyromaniac.  What&#39;s he doing here? 
	Max&#39;s hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket.  A weird gleam
	in his eye.  We see Korfin in the group, speaking to other
	cops.  Nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their
	place in the mass.  She watches Emil with quiet rage.  Cutler
	continues:

				CUTLER (CONT&#39;D)
		...before Emil boards the police boat
		and heads for Rykers Island where he
		will be checked into the psyche ward, I
		want to say one last word to you all...
		As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg
		Razgul into committing these murders,
		yet Oleg is still out in the street, a
		free man, filming gruesome murders... My
		client and I hope he is brought to
		justice in the near future.

	They are through the monuments, approaching the steps when
	Jordy passes a distracted Hawkins - who&#39;s checking his watch
	obsessively.

				HAWKINS
		Where the hell is he?  Goddamn it?!

	Jordy glares at Emil.  Emil looks back at Jordy, gloating. 
	Smiles.  He won.  He beat the system.  Jordy suddenly erupts.

				JORDY
		You think this is funny??  What the hell
		are you laughing at?

	Emil stares down Jordy.  Jordy grips the gun inside the
	jacket.

				CUTLER
			(to a nearby escort)
		Officer, keep this man back, he&#39;s
		assaulted my client on previous
		occasions.

	A PATROLMAN blocks Jordy from Emil.

				JORDY
		This is it?  This bastard kills the best
		cop this city ever had and we do
		nothing?

				CUTLER
		You may not like it marshal, but that&#39;s
		the law.

				JORDY
		And what about the other victims??  What
		about their families?  He&#39;ll end up in
		some country club nuthouse while his
		lawyer sells his rights to the movies
		and we just stand here and do nothing? 
		We let this scumbag walk?

	Jordy moves past the officer.  Emil breaks away from Cutler. 
	Gets in Jordy&#39;s face.  Laughs quietly.

				EMIL
		Be careful.  I can kill you.  I&#39;m
		insane.

	Jordy shoves Emil into Cutler.  A scuffle breaks out as the
	cops separate the two - pulling Jordy back as we cut to:

	A VIDEO POV

	as it approaches Hawkins from behind.  A hand dips into frame
	tapping Hawkins on the shoulder.  Hawkins turns - sees who
	he&#39;s been waiting for.  His face lights up.

				HAWKINS
		I thought you wouldn&#39;t show up.  Where
		is it?  Where is the tape?

	IT&#39;S OLEG

	In disguise - sunglasses and a hat.  Holding his videocamera.

				OLEG
		It&#39;s all in here.  All in here.

	MEANWHILE JORDY

	has been separated from Cutler and Emil as Hawkins&#39; voice
	cuts above the din of the crowd, announcing excitedly:

				HAWKINS
		Wait a minute, Bruce!  We&#39;ve got some
		interesting evidence, something you
		should look at!

	Reporters turn as Hawkins speaks.  His crew is taping as he
	continues introducing his broadcast:

				HAWKINS (CONT&#39;D)
		I have exclusive rights to the ORIGINAL
		UNCUT videotape shot by Oleg Razgul,
		proving Emil Slovak was not insane! 
		Hard to believe...watch!

	Reporters swing their cameras over as Oleg holds his
	videocamera up in the air.

				OLEG (ON VIDEO)
		He knew exactly what he was doing - all
		of this was planned!  It&#39;s all here in
		my movie.  Emil is not insane.  Look. 
		Look!

	Oleg PLAYS his videocamera as lenses focus, we see excerpts
	of the moment where Emil explains to Eddie:

				EMIL (ON VIDEO)
		...so we kill someone famous and if we
		are caught, we are sent to mental
		hospital...

				CUTLER
			(points to Oleg)
		Officers, there&#39;s your killer, do your
		duty, arrest him!

	The police are attempting to get to Oleg, but a sea of
	reporters separate them.  We hear the staccato calls from the
	press corps.  Nicolette looks on in amazed outrage.  Jordy
	notices and starts moving towards her.  Before the POLICE
	CAPTAIN in charge of the detail can react, the rage which
	killed Milos, Tamina and Honey wells up inside Emil.  He
	yells at Oleg!

				EMIL
		Traitor!!

				OLEG
		No.  You are the traitor.  You are
		murderer.  I am director.  Action!

	Oleg pulls his gun.  Emil pulls Cutler in front of him as:

	BANG!

	Oleg FIRES!  Cutler is SHOT and goes down.  Hawkins swings
	his camera over to Oleg - filming the would-be assassin. 
	Oleg FIRES off another SHOT - hitting the COURT OFFICER
	escorting Emil.  Emil grabs the down officer&#39;s gun.  He
	swivels - rapid fires at Oleg.  Oleg topples.  People are
	screaming.  It&#39;s CHAOS.

	Emil darts forward - grabbing Nicolette who is closes to him. 
	He puts his handcuffed arms over her head - points the gun at
	her head.

				CAPTAIN
		Drop the gun!  DON&#39;T SHOOT!

				EMIL
		I&#39;ll kill her!  Back off!  Everyone back
		away from me!

	We hear Jordy&#39;s voice above Emil.

				JORDY
		Let her go.  Let her fucking go!!

	The captain is screaming at all his men.

				CAPTAIN
		No one shoot!  Lower your weapons!  Do
		not fire!  No officer will fire his
		weapon unless I say so!
			(to Emil)
		Let the woman go!

	Cops reluctantly lower their weapons.  But Jordy is still
	aiming his gun at Emil.  He is the only one who hasn&#39;t
	lowered his gun.  The captain is yelling at him.

				CAPTAIN (CONT&#39;D)
		Holster your weapons!  Back away.  That
		is an order!  No officers will fire!

	Emil is screaming back at the captain as Jordy screams at
	Emil.

				EMIL
		Tell him to put his gun down!

				JORDY
		Let her go!  Let her go!!

				EMIL
		If he doesn&#39;t lower his gun I&#39;ll fucking
		kill her.

	Jordy doesn&#39;t lower his gun.  Emil tries to back away.  The
	reporters - who have ducked and covered - are still keeping
	their lenses pointed at the scene.  This is great film! 
	Jordy follows after Emil - his gun raised.

				JORDY
		Let her go.

				NICOLETTE
		Shoot!  Shoot him!!

				EMIL
		Shut up!

	Meanwhile, the captain is still yelling:

				CAPTAIN
		No on shoot!  No one shoot!!  No officer
		will follow.  No officer will shoot!

	Nicolette is still encouraging Jordy.

				NICOLETTE
		Shoot!  Shoot!  Shoot him!!

				EMIL
		Shut up!

	Everyone is screaming at once.  It&#39;s mass chaos.  The captain
	is trying to keep everyone calm.  Cops following along with
	their weapons lowered.  All except Jordy - his gun still
	pointed at Emil. 
	Hawkins can&#39;t believe what footage he&#39;s getting.  He&#39;s
	pushing his cameraman to the front of the pack.  Trying to
	get the best coverage.

				EMIL (CONT&#39;D)
		I&#39;ll surrender!! I&#39;ll surrender if he
		lowers his gun.

	He&#39;s pointing at Jordy but he&#39;s continuing to back away
	towards the police boat.

				NICOLETTE
		Don&#39;t.  Don&#39;t let him surrender.  Shoot
		him!

	Jordy won&#39;t take his gun off him.

				JORDY
		Let her go.  Let her go.

	The captain is yelling at Jordy.

				CAPTAIN
		Lower your weapon.  I told you - lower
		your weapon!

	Jordy struggles to get a clean shot at Emil.  He can&#39;t.  His
	heart pounding.  Adrenaline pumping.  He suddenly lowers his
	weapon.  Turns away.  The captain visibly relaxes.  Emil
	laughs.  Jordy suddenly turns back.  Quickly raises his
	weapon.

	JORDY SHOOTS

	Emil takes a shot in the leg.  Nicolette ducks under the
	handcuffs and scurries away.  Emil looks at Jordy - surprised
	he shot him.  Jordy FIRES AGAIN.  Emil is hit in the
	shoulder.  Jordy marches forward, EMPTYING HIS CLIP in Emil&#39;s
	chest.  Abdomen.  Head.  Gun fire echoes in the humid air as
	Emil stumbles back.  Does a funny dance and drops to the
	ground.  Dead.  The captain yells.

				CAPTAIN (CONT&#39;D)
		I told you not to shoot!  No officers
		should shoot.

	Jordy quietly answers:

				JORDY
		I&#39;m not a cop.  I&#39;m a fire marshal.

				HAWKINS
		He&#39;s still alive.

	Hawkins looks down at Oleg.  He is sprawled on the ground. 
	His videocamera in hand - he&#39;s still making the movie.

	OLEG&#39;S VIDEO POV

	as it ZOOMS from the Statue of Liberty and PANS to Oleg.  He
	looks in the lens with his dying eyes, gasps:

				OLEG
		A film...by Oleg Razgul.

	And Oleg dies but suddenly his eyes pop WIDE OPEN.  Hawkins
	jumps back, Oleg smiles, coughing in pain.

				OLEG (CONT&#39;D)
		How was that?

	Oleg&#39;s head rolls to one side.  Now dead.  Nicolette runs
	over to Jordy.  Composing herself.  Coming together.  Glad
	Emil is dead.  Jordy starts to walk away.

				NICOLETTE
		Wait a minute.  Where are you going? 
		Learn from Eddie.  Talk to the court of
		public opinion.  Take the credit, you
		need it.

	She turns him around.  Straightens his tie.  Starts to push
	the hair out of his face but he stops her hand.

				JORDY
		No thanks.

	Jordy puts something in her hand.  She looks down.  It&#39;s
	EDDIE&#39;S BADGE.  The one Jordy took out of Daphne&#39;s bathroom. 
	She looks up at him.  Her cameraman rolling.  The lens
	pointed at Jordy.  Jordy looks at Nicolette.  Meets her eyes. 
	He doesn&#39;t want to make a statement.  He still doesn&#39;t want
	the fame.  He did learn from Eddie.  Eddie was killed because
	he was a celebrity.  Jordy wants no part of it.

				NICOLETTE
		Cut.

	Her cameraman lowers his leans.  Jordy smiles.  She nods. 
	Jordy turns and walks away.

				NICOLETTE (CONT&#39;D)
		Get a shot of him leaving.  Then pan to
		me.

	Jordy disappears into the sea of people.  The camera PANS
	back to Nicolette.

				NICOLETTE (CONT&#39;D)
		Well, he wouldn&#39;t talk to us, but you
		saw it.

	The CAMERA PULLS BACK from Nicolette&#39;s face and the video is
	now on:

	THE JUMBOTRON IN TIMES SQUARE

	We PULL BACK FURTHER and FURTHER.  Nicolette finishing her
	stand up:

				NICOLETTE (CONT&#39;D)
		New York City has a new hero, Fire
		Marshal Jordan Warsaw.  I hope that Fire
		Marshal Warsaw&#39;s heroic actions this
		afternoon will help with his other legal
		problems.  WB11 has also learned that
		the fire Marshal has retained an
		immigration lawyer to help Daphne
		Handlova with her case.  We wish her
		well.  This is Nicolette Karas, live at
		Battery Park, WB11 New York.  Good
		night.

Transcriber&#39;s note:

For all you Clarke/Kubrick/2001 fans,

I found the original paper copy of this screenplay a while back and felt 
compelled to transcribe it to disk and upload it to various bulletin 
boards for the enjoyment of all.

The final movie deviates from this screenplay in a number of interesting 
ways. I&#39;ve tried to maintain the format of the original document except 
the number of lines per page of the original. In order to reduce the 
length of this file I&#39;ve used a bar of &quot;------&quot; to delimit the pages as 
there was a lot of whitespace per original screenplay page.

A1
VIEWS OF AFRICAN DRYLANDS - DROUGHT

The remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years,
and would not end for another million. The reign of the ter-
rible lizards had long since passed, but here on the continent
which would one day be known as Africa, the battle for survival
had reached a new climax of ferocity, and the victor was not
yet in sight. In this dry and barren land, only the small or
the swift or the fierce could flourish, or even hope to exist.

10/13/65										 a1

INT &amp; EXT CAVES - MOONWATCHER

The man-apes of the field had none of these attributes, and
they were on the long, pathetic road to racial extinction.
About twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking
a small, parched valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream.

The tribe had always been hungry, and now it was starving.
As the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave, Moonwatcher
discovers that his father has died during the night. He did not know
the Old One was his father, for such a relationship was beyond
his understanding. but as he stands looking down at the emac-
iated body he feels something, something akin to sadness. Then
he carries his dead father out of the cave, and leaves him for the
hyenas.

Among his kind, Moonwatcher is almost a giant. He is nearly
five feet high, and though badly undernourished, weighs over
a hundred pounds. His hairy, muscular body is quite man-like,
and his head is already nearer man than ape. The forehead is
low, and there are great ridges over the eye-sockets, yet he
unmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity. As
he looks out now upon the hostile world, there is already

10/13/65										 a2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONTINUED

something in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape. In those
dark, deep-set eyes is a dawning awareness-the first intima-
tions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another
two million years.

10/13/65										 a3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXT  THE STREAM - THE OTHERS

As the dawn sky brightens, Moonwatcher and his tribe reach
the shallow stream.

The Others are already there. They were there on the other
side every day - that did not make it any less annoying.

There are eighteen of them, and it is impossible to distinguish
them from the members of Moonwatcher&#39;s own tribe. As
they see him coming, the Others begin to angrily dance and
shriek on their side of the stream, and his own people reply
In kind.

The confrontation lasts a few minutes - then the display dies
out as quickly as it has begun, and everyone drinks his fill of
the muddy water. Honor has been satisfied - each group has
staked its claim to its own territory.

10/13/65										 a4
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A4
EXT  AFRICAN PLAIN - HERBIVORES

Moonwatcher and his companions search for berries, fruit
and leaves, and fight off pangs of hunger, while all around
them, competing with them for the samr fodder, is a potential
source of more food than they could ever hope to eat. Yet
all the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched
savanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach;
the idea of eating it is beyond their imagination. They are
slowly starving to death in the midst of plenty.

10/13/65										 a5
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A5
EXT  PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE - THE LION

The tribe slowly wanders across the bare, flat country-
side foraging for roots and occasional berries.

Eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain,
about fifty feet apart.

The ground is flat for miles around.

Suddenly, Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion, stalking
them about 300 yards away.

Defenceless and with nowhere to hide, they scatter in all
directions, but the lion brings one to the ground.

10/13/65										 a6
------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXT  DEAD TREE - FINDS HONEY

It had not been a good day, though as Moonwatcher had no
real remembrance of the past he could not compare one day
with another. But on the way back to the caves he finds a
hive of bees in the stump of a dead tree, and so enjoys the
finest delicacy his people could ever know. Of course, he
also collects a good many stings, but he scacely notices
them. He is now as near to contentment as he is ever
likely to be; for thought he is still hungry, he is not actually
weak with hunger. That was the most that any hominid could
hope for.

10/13/65										 a7
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A7
INT &amp; EXT  CAVES - NIGHT TERRORS

Over the valley, a full moon rises, and a cold wind blows down
from the distant mountains. It would be very cold tonight -
but cold, like hunger, was not a matter for any real concern;
it was merely part of the background of life.

This Little Sun, that only shone at night and gave no warmth,
was dangerous; there would be enemies abroad. Moonwatcher
crawls out of the cave, clambers on to a large boulder besides
the entrance, and squats there where he can survey the valley.
If any hunting beast approached, he would have time to get back
to the relative safety of the cave.

Of all the creatures who had ever lived on Earth, Moonwatcher&#39;s
race was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the Moon,
and though he could not remember it, when he was young,
Moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face.
Now he new he would have to find a tree that was high
enough.

He stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from
one of the lower caves, and he does not need to hear the

10/13/65										 a8
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A7
CONTINUED

occasional growl of the lion to know what is happening. Down
there in the darkness, old One-Eye and his family are dying,
and the thought that he might help in some way never crosses
Moonwatcher&#39;s mind. The harsh logic of survival rules out
such fancies. Every cave is silent, lest it attract disaster.

And in the caves, in tortured spells of fitful dozing and
fearful waiting, were gathered the nightmares of generations
yet to come.

10/13/65										 a9
------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXT  THE STREAM - INVASION

The Others are growing desperate; the forage on their side of
the valley is almost exhausted. Perhaps they realise that
Moonwatcher&#39;s tribe has lost three of its numbers during the
night, for they choose this mourning to break the truce. When
they meet at the river in the still, misty dawn, there is a
deeper and more menacing note in their challenge. The noisy
but usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds
before the invasion begins.

In an uncertainly-moving horde, the Others cross the river,
shieking threats and hunched for the attack. They are led
by a big-toothed hominid of Moonwatcher&#39;s own size and age.

Startled and frightened, the tribe retreats before the first
advance, throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations
at the invaders. Moonwatcher moves with them, his mind a
mist of rage and confusion. To be driven from their own
territory is a great badness, but to lose the river is death.
He does not know what to do; it is a situation beyond his
experience.

Then he becomes dimly aware that the Others are slowing

10/13/65										 a10
------------------------------------------------------------------------

down, and advancing with obvious reluctance. The further they
move from their own side, the more uncertain and unhappy
they become. Only Big-Tooth still retains any of his original
drive, and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers.

As he sees this, Moonwatcher&#39;s own morale immediately
revives. He slows down his retreat, and begins to make
reassuring noises to his companions. Novel sensations fill
his dim mind - the first faint precursors of bravery and
leadership.

Before he realizes it, he is face to face with Big-Tooth, and
the two tribes come to a halt many paces away.

The disorganized and unscientific conflict could have ended
quickly if either had used his fist as a club, but this
innovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in the
future. Instead, the slowly weakening fighters claw and
scratch and try to bite each other.

Rolling over and over, they come to a patch of stony ground,
and when they reach it Moonwatcher is on top. By chance,

he chooses this moment to grab the hair on Big-Tooth&#39;s scalp,
and bang his head on the ground. The resulting CRACK is
so satisfactory, and produces such an immediate weakening
In Big - Tooth&#39;s resistance, that he quickly repeats it.

Even when Big-Tooth ceases to move for some time, Moon-
watcher keeps up the exhilirating game.

With shrieks of panic, the Others retreat back, across the
stream. The defenders cautiously pursue them as far as
The water&#39;s edge.

EXT  CAVE - NEW SOUND

Dozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle, Moonwatcher is
startled by a sound.

He sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave, straining his
senses out into the night, and fear creeps slowly into his soul.
Never in his life - already twice as long as most members of
his species could expect - has he heard a sound like this. The
great cats approached in silence, and the only thing that
betrayed them was a rare slide of earth, or the occasional
cracking of a twig. Yet this is a continuing crunching noise
that grows steadily louder. It seemed that some enormous
beast was moving through the night, making no attempt at
concealment, and ignoring all obstacles.

And then there came a sound which Moonwatcher could not
possibly have identified, for it had never been heard before
in the history of this planet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
A10
EXT CAVE - NEW ROCK

Moonwatcher comes face to face with the New Rock when he
leads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning.
He had almost forgotten the terror of the night, because nothing
had happened after that initial noise, so he does not even
associate this strange thing with danger or with fear. There
is nothing in the least alarming about it.

It is a cube about fifteen feet on a side, and it is made of
some completely transparent material; indeed, it is not easy
to see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges.
There are no natural objects to which Moonwatcher can
compare this apparition. Though he is wisely cautious
of most new things, he does not hesitate to walk up to it.
As nothing happens, he puts out his hand, and feels a warm,
hard surface.

After several minutes of intense thought, he arrives at a
brilliant explanation. It is a rock, of course, and it
must have grown during the night. There are many plants
that do this - white, pulpy things shaped like pebbles, that
seem to shoot up in the hours of darkness. It is true that
they are small and round, whereas this is large and square;

10/13/65										 a14
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A10
CONTINUED

but greater and later philosophers than Moonwatcher would be
prepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws.

This really superb piece of abstract thinking leads Moonwatcher
to a deduction which he immediately puts to the test. The white,
round pebble-plants are very tasty (though there were a few
that made one violently sick); perhaps this square one...?

A few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him.
There is no nourishment here; so like a sensible hominid, he
continues on his way to the river and forgets all about the Cube.

10/13/65										 a15
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A11
EXT CUBE - FIRST LESSON

They are still a hundred yards from the New Rock when the
sound begins.

It is quite soft, and it stops them in their tracks, so that they
stand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging. A simple,
maddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube
and hypnotises all who come within its spell. For the first
time - and the last, for two million year - the sound of
drumming is heard in Africa.

The throbbing grows louder, more insistent. Presently the
hominids begin to move forward like sleep-walkers, towards
the source of that magnetic sound. Sometimes they take little
dancing steps, as their blood responds to the rhythms that
their descendants will not create for ages yet.

Totally entranced, they gather around the Cube, forgetting
the hardships of the day, the perils of the approaching dusk,
and the hunger in their bellies.

Now, spinning wheels of light begin to merge, and the spokes
fuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance,

10/13/65										 a16
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A11
CONTINUED

rotating on their axes as they do; and the hominids watch, wide-
eyed, mesmerized captives of the Crystal Cube.

Then by some magic - though it was no more magical than all
that had gone on before - a perfectly normal scene appears. It
is as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day and
shifted into the night. Inside that block is a group of four
hominids, who might have been members of Moonwatcher&#39;s
own tribe, eating chunks of meat. The carcass of a wart-hog
lies near them.

This little family of male and female and two children is gorged
and replete, with sleek and glossy pelts - and this was a
condition of life that Moonwatcher had never imagined. From
time to time they stir lazily, as they loll at ease near the
entrance of their cave, apparently at peace with the world.
The spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totally
different scene.

The family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave;
it is foraging, searching for food like any normal hominids.

10/13/65										 a17
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A11
CONTINUED

A small wart-hog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids
without giving them more than a glance, for they had never been
the slightest danger to its species.

But that happy state of affairs is about to end. The big male
suddenly bends down, picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet -
and hurls it upon the unfortunate pig. The stone descends upon
its skull, making exactly the same noise that Moonwatcher had
produced in his now almost forgotten encounter with Big-Tooth.
And the result, too, is much the same - the warthog gives one
amazed, indignant squeal, and collapses in a motionless heap.

Then the whole sequence begins again, but this time it unfolds
itself with incredible slowness. Every detail of the movement
can be followed; the stone arches leisurely through the air, the
pig crumples up and sinks to the ground. There the scene
freezes for long moments, the slayer standing motionless
above the slain, the first of all weapons in his hand.

The scene suddenly fades out. The cube is no more than a
glimmering outline in the darkness; the hominids stir, as if

10/13/65										 a18
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A11
CONTINUED

awakening from a dream, realise where they are, and scuttle
back to their caves.

They have no concious memory of what they had seen; but that
night, as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair, his ears
attuned to the noises of the world around him, Moonwatcher
feels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion - the urge
to kill. He had taken his first step towards humanity.

A12
EXT cave AND PLAINS - Utopia

Babies were born and sometimes lived; feeble, toothless thirty-
year-olds died; the lion took its toll in the night; the Others
threatened daily across the river - and the trib prospered.
In the course of a single year, Moonwatcher and his companions
had changed almost beyond recognition.

They had become as plump as the family in the Cave, who no
longer haunted their dreams. They had learned their lessons
well; now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that
the Cube had revealed to them.

They were no longer half-numbed with starvation, and they
had time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought.
Their new way of life was casually accepted, and they did
not associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standing
outside their cave.

But no Utopia is perfect, and this one had two blemishes. The
first was the marauding lion, whose passion for hominids
seemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better
nourished. The second was the tribe across the river; for

10/13/65										 a20

somehow the Others had survived, and had stubbornly refused to
die of starvation.

10/13/65										 a21

A13
EXT CAVES - KILLING THE LION

With the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the
ground at the point he hope the boulder would impact, Moon-
watcher and three of his bravest companions wait for two
consecutive nights. On the third the lion comes,
betraying his presences by a small pebble slide.

When they can here the lion below, softly tearing at the meat,
they strain themselves against the massive boulder. The sound
of the lion stops; he is listening. Again they silently heave
against the enormous stone, exerting the final limits of their
strength. The rock begin to tip to a new balance point.

The lion twitches alert to this sound, but having no fear of these
creatures, he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost
him his life; he goes back to his meal.

The rock moves slowly over the ledge, picking up speed with
amazing suddeness. It strikes a projection in the cliff about
fifteen feet above the ground, which deflects its path outward.

Just at this instant, the lion reacts instinctively and leaps
away from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the

10/13/65										 a22
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A13
CONTINUED

onrushing boulder. He has combined the errors of over-
confidence and bad luck.

The next morning they find the lion in front of the cave. They
also find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to
see what was happening, and was apparently killed by a small
rock torn loose by the boulder; but this was a small price to
pay for such a great victory.

					  * * * * * * * *

And then one night the crystal cube was gone, and not even
Moonwatcher ever thought of it again. He was still wholly
unaware of all that it had done.

10/13/65										 a23
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A14
EXT STREAM - MASTER OF THE WORLD

From their side of the stream, in the never violated safety of
their own territory, the Others see Moonwatcher and fourteen
males of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over-
looking the stream, silhouetted against the dawn sky.

The Others begin to scream their daily challenge. But today
something is different, though the Others do not immediatly
recognize this fact.

Instead of joining the verbal onslaught, as they had always done,
Moonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise, and
begin to move forward to the stream with a quiet purposefulness
never befor seen.

As the Others watch the figures silently approaching in the
morning mist, they become aware of the terrible strangness
of this encounter, and their rage gradually subsides down to
an uneasy silence.

At the water&#39;s edge, Moonwatcher and his band stop. They
carry their bone clubs and bone knives.

10/13/65										 a24
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A14
CONTINUED

Led by One-ear, the Others half-heartly resume the battle-
chant. But they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cuts
the sound from their throats, and strikes terror into their
hearts.

Moonwatcher, who had been partly concealed by two males who
walked before him, thrusts his arm high into the air. In his
hand he holds a stoud tree branch. Mounted atop the branch is
the bloody head of the lion, its mouth jammed open with a stick,
displaying its frightful fangs.

The Others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power.

Moonwatchers stands motionless, thrusting the lion&#39;s head high.
Then with majestic deliberation, still carrying his mangled
standard above his head, he begins to cross the stream, followed
by his band.

The Others fade back from the stream, seeming to lack even
the ability to flee.

Moonwatcher steps ashore and walks to One-Ear, who stands

10/13/65										 a25
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A14
CONTINUED

unsurely in front of his band.

Though he is a veteran of numerous combats at the water&#39;s edge,
One-Ear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first
displayed his fighting rage; and he had never before been attacked
with a weapon. One-Ear, merely looks up at the raised club
until the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness
down around him.

The Others stare in wonder at Moonwatcher&#39;s power.

Moonwatcher surveys the scene. Now he was master of the
world, and he was not sure what to do next. But he would
think of something.

					    (pleasantly)  Well, Dr. Floyd,

					    you can clear up the mystery
					    about what&#39;s been going on up

					    FLOYD
					    I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m not sure
					    I know what you mean.

					    SMYSLOV
					    Well, it&#39;s just for the past
					    two weeks there have been
					    some extremely odd things
					    happening at Clavius.

					    FLOYD
					    Really?

					    SMYSLOV
					    Yes. Well, for one thing,
					    whenever you phone the base,
					    all you can get is a recording
					    which repeats that the phone
					    lines are temporarily out of
					    order.

					    SMYSLOV
					    Yes, well at first we thought
					    that was the explanation, but
					    it&#39;s been going on for the past
					    ten days.

					    FLOYD
					    You mean you haven&#39;t been able
					    to get anyone at the base for ten
					    days?

					    SMYSLOV
					    That&#39;s right.

					    FLOYD
					    I see.

					    ELENA
					    Another thing, Heywood, two
					    days ago, one of our rocket

					    FLOYD
					    Well, that does sound very odd.

					    SMYSLOV
					    Yes, and I&#39;m afaid there&#39;s
					    going to be a bit of a row about
					    it. Denying the men permission
					    to land was a direct violation of
					    the I.A.S. convention.

					    FLOYD
					    Yes... Well, I hope the crew

					    haven&#39;t been able to get her on
					    the phone for the past week or so,

					    FLOYD
					    I see. Well, I&#39;m sorry about that.
					    I wouldn&#39;t think there&#39;s any cause
					    for alarm.

					    PILOT
					    Yes, well, I wouldn&#39;t have been
					    too concerned about it, except
					    I&#39;ve heard these stories about the

					    deepest appreciation to all of
					    you for the personal sacrifices
					    you have made, and of course
					    his congratulations on your
					    discovery which may well prove

					    FLOYD (cont&#39;d)
					    Mr. Halvorsen has made known
					    to me some of the conflicting
					    views held by many of you
					    regarding the need for complete
					    security in this matter, and
					    more specifically your strong
					    opposition to the cover story
					    created to give the impression
					    there is an epidemic at the Base.
					    I understand that beyond it being
					    a matter of principle, many of
					    you are troubled by the concern
					    and anxiety this story of an
					    epidemic might cause your
					    relatives and friends on Earth.

					    I can understand and sympathize
					    with your negative views. I have
					    been personally embarrassed by
					    this cover story. But I fully
					    accept the need for absolute
					    secrecy and I hope you will.

					    It should not be difficult for all
					    of you to realise the potential for
					    cutural shock and social
					    disorientation contained in the
					    present situation if the facts
					    were prematurely and suddenly
					    made public without adequate
					    preparation and conditioning.

					    FLOYD
					    This is the view of the Council

					    is to gather addition facts and
					    opinions on the situation and to
					    prepare a report to the Council
					    recommending when and how the
					    news should eventually be
					    announced. Are there any
					    questions?

					    MICHAELS
					    Dr. Floyd, how long do you think
					    this can be kept under wraps?

					    FLOYD
					    (pleasantly)
					    I&#39;m afraid it can and it will be
					    kept under wraps as long as it
					    is deemed to be necessary by
					    the Council. And of course you
					    know that the Council has requested
					    that formal security oaths are to
					    be obtained in writing from every-
					    one who had any knowledge of this
					    event. There must be adequate
					    time for a full study to be made
					    of the situation before any con-

					    FLOYD
					    Does your geology on it still
					    check out?

					    MICHAELS
					    Yes, it does. The sub-surface
					    structure shows that it was
					    deliberately buried about four
					    million years ago.

					    FLOYD
					    How can you tell it was
					    deliberately buried?

					    MICHAELS
					    By the deformation between
					    the mother rock and the fill.

					    FLOYD
					    Any clue as to what it is?

					    MICHAELS
					    Not really. It&#39;s completely
					    inert. No sound or energy
					    sources have been detected.
					    The surface is made of
					    something incredibly hard
					    and we&#39;ve been barely able
					    to scratch it. A laser drill

					    MICHAELS
					    might do something, but we

					    But you don&#39;t have any idea as
					    to what it is?

					    MICHAELS
					    Tomb, shine, survey-marker
					    spare part, take your choice.

					    HALVORSEN
					    The only thing about it that we are
					    sure of is that it is the first direct
					    evidence of intelligent life beyond
					    the Earth.

SILENT APPRECIATION

					    HALVORSEN
					    Four million years ago, something,
					    presumably from the stars, must
					    have swept through the solar
					    system and left this behind.

					    FLOYD
					    Was it abandoned, forgotten, left

					    I suppose we&#39;ll never know.

					    MICHAELS
					    The moon would have made an
					    excellent base camp for
					    preliminary Earth surveys.

SOME MORE SILENCE

					    FLOYD
					    Any ideas about the colour?

					    MICHAELS
					    Well, not really. At first glance,
					    black would suggest something
					    sun-powered, but then why would
					    anyone deliberately bury a sun-
					    powered device?

					    FLOYD
					    Has it been exposed to any sun
					    before now?

					    MICHAELS
					    I don&#39;t think it has, but I&#39;d
					    like to check that. Simpson,
					    what&#39;s the log on that?

VARIOUS SHOTS OF
SPACE MONITORS,
ASTEROIDS, THE SUN,
PLUTO, MARS.

					    NARRATOR
					    A hundred million miles beyond
					    Mars, in the cold lonliness
					    where no man had yet travelled,
					    Deep-Space-Monitor-79 drifts
					    slowly among the tangled orbits
					    of the asteroids.

					    NARRATOR
					    Radiation detectors noted and
					    analyzed incoming cosmic rays
					    from the galaxy and points beyond;
					    neutron and x-ray telescopes
					    kept watch on strange stars that
					    no human eye would eever see;
					    magnetometers observed the
					    gusts and hurricanes of the solar
					    winds, as the sun breathed million
					    mile-an-hour blasts of plasma
					    into the faces of its circling
					    children.

					    NARRATOR
					    All these things and many others
					    were patiently noted by Deep-
					    Space-Monitor-79, and recorded
					    in its crystalline memory.

11/25/65										 b68

CONTINUED

					    NARRATOR
					    But now it had noted something
					    strange - the faint yet
					    unmistakable distrubance rippling
					    across the solar system, and
					    quite unlike any natural phenomena
					    it had ever observed in the past.

					    NARRATOR
					    It was also observed by Orbiter
					    M-15, circling Mars twice a
					    day; and High Inclination Probe-
					    21, climbing slowly above the
					    planet of the ecliptic; and even
					    artificial Comet-5, heading out
					    into the cold wastes beyond
					    Pluto, along an orbit whose
					    far point it would not reach for
					    a thousand years.

					    NARRATOR
					    All noticed the peculiar burst of
					    energy that leaped from the face
					    of the Moon and moved across
					    the solar system, throwing off a
					    spray of radiation like the wake of
					    a racing speedboat.

					    POOLE
					    Dave, if you&#39;ve a minute, I&#39;d like
					    your advice on something.

					    BOWMAN
					    Sure, what is it?

					    POOLE
					    Well, it&#39;s nothing really important,
					    but it&#39;s annoying.

					    BOWMAN
					    What&#39;s up?

					    POOLE
					    It&#39;s about my salary cheques.

					    BOWMAN
					    Yes?

					    POOLE
					    Well I got the papers on my
					    official up-grading to AGS-19
					    two weeks before we left.

12/14/65										 c12 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
C12
CONTINUED

					    BOWMAN
					    Yes, I remember you mentioning it.
					    I got mine about the same time.

					    POOLE
					    That&#39;s right. Well, naturally,
					    I didn&#39;t say anything to Payroll.
					    I assumed they&#39;d start paying me
					    at the higher grade on the next pay
					    cheque. But it&#39;s been almost
					    three weeks now and I&#39;m still
					    being paid as an AGS-18.

					    BOWMAN
					    Interesting that you mention it,
					    because I&#39;ve got the same problem.

					    POOLE
					    Really.

					    BOWMAN
					    Yes.

					    POOLE
					    Yesterday, I finally called the
					    Accounting Office at Mission
					    Control, and all they could tell me
					    was that they&#39;d received the AGS-19
					    notification for the other three but
					    not mine, and apparently not yours
					    either.

12/14/65										 c13 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
C12
CONTINUED

					    BOWMAN
					    Did they have any explanation for
					    this?

					    POOLE
					    Not really. They just said it might
					    be because we trained at Houston and
					    they trained in Marshall, and that
					    we&#39;re being charged against differ-
					    ent accounting offices.

					    BOWMAN
					    It&#39;s possible.

					    POOLE
					    Well, what do you think we ought
					    to do about it?

					    BOWMAN
					    I don&#39;t think we should make any
					    fuss about it yet. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll
					    straighten it out.

					    POOLE
					    I must say, I never did understand
					    why they split us into two groups
					    for training.

					    BOWMAN
					    No. I never did, either.

12/14/65										 c14 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
C12
CONTINUED

					    POOLE
					    We spent so little time with them,
					    I have trouble keeping their names
					    straight.

					    BOWMAN
					    I suppose the idea was specialized
					    training.

					    POOLE
					    I suppose so. Though, of course,
					    there&#39;s a more sinister explanation.

					    BOWMAN
					    Oh?

					    POOLE
					    Yes. You must have heard the
					    rumour that went around during
					    orbital check-out.

					    BOWMAN
					    No, as a matter of fact, I didn&#39;t.

					    POOLE
					    Oh, well, apparently there&#39;s
					    something about the mission that
					    the sleeping beauties know that
					    we don&#39;t know, and that&#39;s why we
					    were trained separately and
					    that&#39;s why they were put to sleep
					    before they were even taken aboard.

12/14/65										 c15 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
C12
CONTINUED

					    BOWMAN
					    Well, what is it?

					    POOLE
					    I don&#39;t know. All I heard is that
					    there&#39;s something about the
					    mission we weren&#39;t told.

					    BOWMAN
					    That seems very unlikely.

					    POOLE 
					    Yes, I thought so.

					    BOWMAN
					    Of course, it would be very easy
					    for us to find out now.

					    POOLE
					    How?

					    BOWMAN
					    Just ask Hal. It&#39;s conceivable
					    they might keep something from
					    us, but they&#39;d never keep anything
					    from Hal.

					    POOLE
					    That&#39;s true.

POOLE WALKS TO THE
HAL 9000 COMPUTER

					    POOLE
					    Hal... Dave and I believe that
					    there&#39;s something about the
					    mission that we weren&#39;t told.
					    Something that the rest of the
					    crew know and that you know.
					    We&#39;d like to know whether this
					    is true.

					    HAL
					    I&#39;m sorry, Frank, but I don&#39;t
					    think I can answer that question
					    without knowing everything that
					    all of you know.

					    BOWMAN
					    He&#39;s got a point.

					    POOLE
					    Okay, then how do we re-phrase
					    the question?

12/14/65										 c15c	  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
C12 
CONTINUED

					    BOWMAN
					    Still, you really don&#39;t believe it,
					    do you?

					    POOLE
					    Not really. Though, it is strange
					    when you think about it. It didn&#39;t
					    really make any sense to keep
					    us apart during training.

					    BOWMAN
					    Yes, but it&#39;s to fantastic to think
					    that they&#39;d keep something from us.

					    POOLE
					    I know. It would be almost
					    inconceivable.

					    BOWMAN
					    But not completely inconceivable?

					    POOLE
					    I suppose it isn&#39;t logically impossible.

					    BOWMAN
					    I guess it isn&#39;t.

					    POOLE
					    Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.

12/14/65										 c15b

C12
CONTINUED

					    BOWMAN
					    Well, the only important aspect of
					    the mission are: where are we
					    going, what will we do when we
					    get there, when are we coming
					    back, and... why are we going?

					    POOLE
					    Right. Hal, tell me whether the
					    following statements are true or
					    false.

					    HAL
					    I will if I can, Frank.

					    POOLE
					    Our Mission Profile calls for
					    Discovery going to Saturn.
					    True or false?

					    HAL
					    True.

					    POOLE
					    Our transit time is 257 days. Is
					    that true?

					    HAL
					    That&#39;s true.

12/14/65										 c15d
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
C12
CONTINUED

					    POOLE
					    At the end of a hundred days of
					    exploration, we will all go into 
					    hibernation. Is this true?

					    HAL
					    That&#39;s true.

					    POOLE
					    Approximately five years after we
					    go into hibernation, the recovery
					    vehicle will make rendezous with
					    us and bring us back. Is this true?

					    HAL
					    That&#39;s true

					    POOLE
					    There is no other purpose for this
					    mission than to carry out a
					    continuation of the space program,
					    and to further our general
					    knowledge of the planets. Is that
					    true?

					    HAL

					    MISSION CONTROL
					    I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about
					    the computer. First of all,
					    there is still a chance that he
					    is right, despite your tests,
					    and if it should happen again,
					    we suggest eliminating this
					    possibility by allowing the unit
					    to remain in place and seeing
					    whether or not it actually fails.

					    If the computer should turn out
					    to be wrong, the situation is
					    still not alarming. The type
					    of obsessional error he may be
					    guilty of is not unknown among
					    the latest generation of HAL
					    9000 computers.

					    It has almost always revolved
					    around a single detail, such as
					    the one you have described, and
					    it has never interfered with the
					    integrity or reliability of the
					    computer&#39;s performance in
					    other areas.

					    No one is certain of the cause
					    of this kind of malfunctioning.

					    We believe it all started about two
					    months ago when you and Frank

					    POOLE&#39;S VOICE
					    The purpose of this mission is no
					    more than to carry out a
					    continuation of the space program
					    and further our general knowledge
					    of the planets. Is this true?

					    HAL&#39;S VOICE
					    That is true.

					    SIMONSON
					    Well, I&#39;m afaid Hal was lying.
					    He had been programmed to lie
					    about this one subject for secur-
					    ity reasons which we&#39;ll explain
					    later.

					    The true purpose of the Mission
					    was to have been explained to you
					    by Mission Commander Kaminsky,
					    on his revival. Hal knew this and
					    he knew the actual mission, but
					    he couldn&#39;t tell you the truth when
					    you challenged him. Under orders
										    (con&#39;t)

12/13/65										 c120
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
C148
CONTINUED

					    SIMONSON (con&#39;t)
					    from earth he was forced to lie.

					    In everything except this he had
					    the usual reinforced truth program-
					    ming.

					    We believe his truth programming
					    and the instructions to lie,
					    gradually resulted in an
					    incompatible conflict, and
					    facedc with this dilemman, he
					    developed, for want of a better
					    description, neurotic symptoms.

					    It&#39;s not difficult to suppose that
					    these symptoms would centre on
					    the communication link with
					    Earth, for he may have blamed
					    us for his incompatible program-
					    ming.

					    Following this lin of thought, we
					    suspected that the last straw for him
					    was the possibility of disconnection.
					    Since he became operational, he had
					    never known unconsciousness. It
					    must have seemed the equivalent to
					    death.

					    At this point, he, presumably,

					    him to be his human tormentors.

					    If I cane speak in human terms,
					    I don&#39;t think we can blame him
					    too much. We have ordered him
					    to disobey his conscience.

					    Well, that&#39;s it. It&#39;s very
					    speculative, but we think it is

FLOYD&#39;S RECORDED
BRIEFING

					    FLOYD
					    Good day, gentlemen. When you
					    see this briefing, I presume you
					    will be nearing your destination,
					    Saturn. I hope that you&#39;ve had a
					    pleasant and uneventful trip and
					    that the rest of your mission
					    continues in the same manner. I
					    should like to fill you in on some
					    more of the details on which
					    Mission Commander Kaminsky
					    will have already briefed you.

					    Thirteen months before the launch
					    date of your Saturn mission, on
					    April 12th, 2001, the first evidence
					    for intelligent life outside the Earth
					    was discovered.

					    It was found buried at a depth of
					    fifteen metres in the crater Tycho.
					    No news of this was ever announced,
					    and the event had been kept
					    secret since then, for reasons which
					    I will later explain.

					    Soon after it was uncovered, it
					    emitted a powerful blast of

					    FLOYD (con&#39;t)
					    radiation in the radio spectrum
					    which seems to have triggered
					    by the Lunar sunrise.

					    Luckily for those at the site, it
					    proved harmless.

					    Perhaps you can imagine our
					    astonishment when we later found
					    it was aimed precisely at Saturn.
					    A lot of thought went into the
					    question of wether or not it was
					    sun-triggered, as it seemed
					    illogical to deliberately bury a
					    sun-powered device.

					    Burying it could only shield it
					    from the sun, since its intense
					    magnetic field made it otherwise
					    easily detectable.

					    We finally concluded that the only

					    We&#39;ve examined dozens of theories,
					    but the one that has the most
					    currency at the moment is that
					    the object serves as an alarm.

					    What the purpose of the alarm is,
					    why they wish to have the alarm,
					    whether the alarm represents

					    questions no one can answer.
					    The intentions of an alien world,
					    at least four million years older
					    than we are, cannot be reliably
					    predicted.

					    In view of this, the intelligence

					    Those who had begun the expri-

					    men.

					    But when they looked out across
					    the deeps of space, they felt
					    awe and wonder - and loneliness.

					    In their explorations, they
					    encountered life in many forms,
					    and watched on a thousand worlds
					    the workings of evolution.

					    They saw how often the first faint
					    sparks of intelligence flickered
					    and died in the cosmic night.

					    And because, in all the galaxy,
					    they had found nothing more
					    precious than Mind, they
					    encouraged its dawning every-

					    Strange and beautiful and terrible
					    empires rose and fell, and passed

					    Earth was not forgotten, but it was
					    one of a million silent worlds, a

					    Then the first explorers of Earth,
					    recognising the limitations of

					    Not one of them ever looked through

					    But even the age of the Machine

					    in the structure of space itself,
					    and to preserve their thoughts
					    for eternity in frozen lattices
					    of light. They could become
					    creatures of radiation, free
					    at last from the tyranny of matter.

					    Now, they were Lords of the

					    The companion of Saturn knew

					    For many weeks, it had watched
					    the approaching ship. Its long-

FADE IN:

OPEN COUNTRY - DAY

	Endless green hills bisected by a ribbon of highway. A road
	gang clearing brush by the side of the road... Twenty-five
	men in prison fatigues sweating through their mid-afternoon
	labor.

	THREE GUARDS

	Flank the working prisoners... Mountie hats, shotguns,
	sidearms, sunglasses; they look like they mean it.

	HIGHWAY

	A battered pickup appears...approaches. Suddenly, it coughs,
	shudders, stalls. A big Blackfoot Indian named BILLY BEAR
	gets out and starts cursing and kicking the vehicle.Then he
	begins walking toward the road gang...

	ROADSIDE

	BRADY is the Guard near the center of the work gang; he
	smiles at the oncoming man, pokes a prisoner beside him.

					BRADY
			Wonder what reservation they let
			him off of...

	The prisoner is GANZ who looks up, grins at Brady...

					GANZ
			Yeah, there goes the neighborhood.

	Brady laughs as Billy Bear closes in on him.

					BILLY
			Say, buddy, my engine&#39;s
			overheating and I got 30 miles
			before the next station... Could
			I get some water out of your
			cooler?

	Ganz leans on his hoe, speaks as Billy passes...

					GANZ
			Maybe you shoulda stole a better
			truck, Tonto.

					BILLY
			You got a real big mouth, convict.

					BRADY
			It&#39;s okay, chief.  He&#39;s just
			joking...

					BILLY
			How about the water...

					GANZ
			Firewater, Tonto?  Is that what
			you...

	Billy whirls, swings at Ganz. Both men roll to the ground.

					BRADY
			Hey! Jesus Christ!

	THE OTHER GUARDS

	Seeing the commotion, they run toward it.

	GANZ AND BILLY

	As they struggle, Billy slips a pistol into Ganz&#39; hand.

					BRADY
			That&#39;s a state prisoner,
			asshole...! Back off...

	ROADSIDE

	Brady pulls Billy away from Ganz just &#39;as one of the other
	officers arrives... Ganz suddenly whips out a pistol, shoots
	Brady at point-blank range. Before the other Guards can even
	react, Billy comes out with his own pistol, caps the Second
	Guard.

	THIRD GUARD

	Still forty yards away... In mid-draw, be howls as a bullet
	from Ganz breaks the nearby ground. He fires, then turns and
	runs for the prison bus.

	GANZ

	Smiling, fires twice. but the range is too great for pistol
	work...

	THE OTHER PRISONERS

	Watching....Then they all scatter in different directions...

	GANZ

	Hefts his weapon...

					GANZ
			Come on...

	He and the big Indian run to the pickup, climb in and roar
	away.

	INT. BUS

	The THIRD GUARD making a call on the police radio...

					OFFICER
			APO 657, Unit 25 to APO 478t APO
			657t Unit 25 to APO 478.

					RADIO RESPONSE
			Go ahead, Unit 25.

					OFFICER
			Escape in progress. Two officers
			shot off rail crossing 31.
			Prisoners escaping. Two men, one
			six-four, 200 pounds, dark, an
			Indian, the other, Albert Ganz,
			five-ten...

	FURTHER DOWN THE HIGHWAY

	Several miles from the escape... A big semi parked by the
	side of ttie road; back doors to the closed trailer open. A
	station wagon parked across the road. The pickup appears,
	approaches the semi, slows down and drives up the ramp into
	the van. Ganz and Billy jump out, shove the ramp up inside
	the truck and close the big doors.

	STATION WAGON

	Ganz and Billy climb inside ancl roar off, back in the
	direction of the road gang.

	BILLY BEAR

	Takes off his hat, puts on a baseball cap and sunglasses...

					BILLY
			Get ready to duck.

	Ganz dives for the floor. Three police cars go by, sirens
	blaring, lights flashing. They pass the road gang. Ganz
	reappear, smiles...

					GANZ
			You know something? I&#39;m having a
			real good time.

	HIGHWAY

	The station wagon blasts down the pavement... Becomes a small
	dot on the landscape.

	TRANSITION.

	A DOORWAY - NIGHT

	the portal slams open revealing a man holding a huge
	pistol,jack cates, s.F.P.D., a large and powerful man... He
	stealthily moves up a stairwell.

	CORRIDOR

	He stops at the top of the stairs... Listens gun still ready.
	A continuous sound of running water... Cates moves toward the
	bathroom. Rips the door open.

	BATHROOM

	The shape behind the shower curtain freezes. Cates, gun held
	level, moves forward... Rips the shower curtain open.
	Revealing a young and very beautiful woman, ELAINE MARSHALL.

					CATES
			Inspector Jack Cates, S.F.P.D....
			And you&#39;re wanted.

	Elaine stares at him as Cates turns off the water.

					ELAINE
			What am I wanted for?

					CATES
			I don&#39;t answer questions, I ask
			&#39;em...

	A moment as she continues to stare at his pistol.

					ELAINE
			I don&#39;t think your gun&#39;s loaded...

					CATES
			This is a .44 Magnum, the most
			powerful handgun in the world. You
			gotta ask yourself just one
			question. Are you feelin&#39; lucky?

					ELAINE
			I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s loaded.

	Elaine shakes her head and smiles, folds her arms over her
	breasts, shivers a little... Cates looks at the cylinder,
	spins it...

					CATES
			Hey, you&#39;re right.

					ELAINE
			You&#39;re hopeless.

					CATES
			That&#39;s the way I see it, too.

	Be puts the gun down on the edge of the sink, embraces her.

					ELAINE
			I&#39;m all wet.

					CATES
			What&#39;s wrong with that?

	They both smile.

	TRANSITION.

	BEDROOM

	Cates in bed with Elaine.  She wears his shirt.

					ELAINE
			A guy in the bar called me a dumb
			bitch today.

					CATES
			What&#39;d you do?

					ELAINE
			Irrigated his face with the shot
			of J and B I&#39;d just poured him.
			Then I tried to deck the sucker.

					CATES
			I guess he got the message...

					ELAINE
			Then I sit back and I think, I
			mean, who&#39;s to say I&#39;m not a dumb
			bitch.  I work in a bar, right?
			I can&#39;t read a list of my academic
			credentials to every booze-hound
			that comes in the place... You are
			what you do...

					CATES
			Positive self-image problem all
			over again ... You are who you
			decide you are unless you&#39;re the
			type that lets assholes decide for
			you.

					ELAINE
			Aren&#39;t you the one that thinks all
			psychotherapy is bullshit?

					CATES
			I do think all psychotherapy is
			bullshit. But just because I think
			it&#39;s bullshit doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t
			know something about it.

					ELAINE
			If this is your idea of
			sympathetic interest in my
			problems, I&#39;ll take brutal
			indifference.

					CATES
			Hey, you know what I really think?

					ELAINE
			Tell me--I&#39;m dyin&#39; to hear it.

					CATES
			I think you&#39;re ashamed to tend bar
			which is sad because you look
			great in that outfit they make you
			wear... You pull down four bills
			a week which is damn good, and you
			mix the best Pina Coladas I&#39;ve
			ever had... I think that if you
			need bigger and better things ...
			then go for em.

	She smiles at him after this. It looks like they&#39;ll kiss.
	Their faces are close.  Then she lightly moves back.

					ELAINE
			You oversimplify every...

	He stops her in the middle of the sentence by kissing her,
	then pulls back...

					CATES
			Some things are simple, right?

	Their faces are very close ... but they don&#39;t touch for
	another second.

					ELAINE
			Right...

	TRANSITION.

	SAN FRANCISCO - DAWN

	Titles continue.

	Tugs churning across the bay... Quiet city streets. Parked
	cars covered with early morning dew... A newspaper truck
	slowly grinds by, drops a bundleand moves on.

	EMBARCADERO - DAWN

	The station wagon pulls up to a young punk, HENRY WONG, on a
	motorcycle.

	Billy Bear smiles and leans out the driver&#39;s side window.

					BILLY
			You got somethin&#39; for us, Henry?

	Henry produces some credit cards.  Billy passes them to Ganz
	for inspection.

					GANZ
			How hot are they?

					HENRY
			Hot?  Hey, they&#39;re not even room
			temperature.

	Ganz snorts derisively.

					GANZ
			How ya doin&#39;?

					HENRY
			Can&#39;t complain.

					GANZ
			We got a lot to talk about.

					HENRY
			Yeah, old times.

					GANZ
			We&#39;ll follow you.  Take it
			slow,okay?

					HENRY
			Sure, right.

	Ganz pockets the credit cards as Henry wheels away.

	INT.  STATION WAGON

	INT.  STATION WAGON

					GANZ
			Maybe after we get done with him
			I&#39;m gonna buy us some girls.

					BILLY
			Whaddya mean, buy?

					GANZ
			Pros.

	Ganz stares at Billy.

					BILLY
			Pay money?

					GANZ
			Yeah, dummy.  Money.

					BILLY
			I never paid for it in my life.

					GANZ
			It&#39;s better when you pay... they
			let you do anything.

					BILLY
			They always let me do anything. I
			don&#39;t want to pay for it.  I never
			paid for it in my life.

					GANZ
			Just do what I say, okay? We&#39;ll
			pay for the girls and have a good
			time... Don&#39;t you trust me?

	Billy smiles.

					BILLY
			Sure, I trust ya.

	They drive off.

	NORTH BEACH - RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAWN

	First light breaks over Telegraph Hill. A quiet row of
	Victorian townhouses now converted into apartments.

	APARTMENT BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

	Cates is sprawled across the double bed; Elaine is on the
	verge of falling off the edge. Cates&#39; eyes snap open.  A
	second later, his wrist watch alarm goes off.  He turns it
	off, gets out of bed and begins pulling on his pants. Elaine
	sits up in bed, still wearing Cates&#39; blue shirt... Cates
	picks up a robe as Elaine gets out of bed on the opposite
	side, throws the robe to Elaine... She takes off the shirt,
	swaps it for the robe and throws the shirt to Jack.

					ELAINE
			You know, if you let me come over
			to your place once in a while, you
			could put on a clean shirt in the
			morning.

					CATES
			What makes you think I have any
			clean shirts at my place?

	He buttons his shirt and heads for the kitchen.

	KITCHEN

	Cates brushing his teeth at the sink, Elaine making coffee.

					ELAINE
			You know, that&#39;s my toothbrush,
			Jack.

	He keeps brushing.

					CATES
			Maybe you ought to buy me one.

					ELAINE
			Maybe I would if I knew when you
			were coming back.

	He stops brushing, turns and looks at her.

					CATES
			I&#39;m here.  And I&#39;ve been coming
			back for quite awhile... Let&#39;s not
			hassle, okay?  And can I have a
			cup of coffee?  Please.

	She pours some coffee, hands him a cup and saucer... Cates
	pours some whiskey into it from a flask.

					ELAINE
			That&#39;s a fairly crummy way to
			start a morning.

					CATES
			Maybe I got a fairly crummy day
			ahead.

					ELAINE
			Maybe that makes a nice excuse.

					CATES
			Maybe you don&#39;t know what the hell
			you&#39;re talking about.

	Cates picks his holstered .44 off a chair back and begins
	strapping it on.

					ELAINE
			When you start with that
			attitude... it&#39;s like I don&#39;t know
			who you are.

					CATES
			What do you want to know?  What
			difference does it make?  I&#39;m the
			guy in your bed the last three
			months.  I make you feel good. You
			make me feel good.  What the hell
			else do you want from a guy?

					ELAINE
			I wish you&#39;d stop trying to make
			me mad so I won&#39;t care for you...
			I wish you&#39;d give me a little more
			of a chance.

	He turns away, moves into the corridor near the stairwell.

					CATES
			I don&#39;t have time for this. I
			gotta go to work.

	She stands frozen... He turns back and looks at her; it&#39;s
	hard to apologize.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			Look, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m in your life...
			and hell, with an ass like yours,
			I figure anything might be
			possible.

	She is warmed up by the first part, amused by the second; she
	approaches...

					ELAINE
			You know something, Jack, you
			really are hopeless.

					CATES
			That&#39;s the way I see it, too.

					ELAINE
			Call me later.

					CATES
			You sure you want me to?

					ELAINE
			Yeah, for some reason, I&#39;m sure...

	He moves closer, kisses her..

					CATES
			Thanks for the coffee.

					ELAINE
			I think you forgot this. Hands him
			his wallet and badge...

					CATES
			Guess people ought to know who I
			am...

	He turns to go down the stairwell...

					ELAINE
			Jack, wait.  Here...

	She puts a scarf around his neck.

					ELAINE
					 (continuing)
			It&#39;s cold as hell out these
			mornings, and you know what the
			man said, the coldest winter I
			ever spent was the summer I spent
			in San Francisco...

	They don&#39;t kiss.  He nods appreciately, the scarf in hand as
	he turns and goes.

	STREET - NORTH BEACH - MORNING

	Cates comes out of Elaine&#39;s apartment building, crosses to
	his whipped and battered  64 Cadillac convertible, notices a
	parking ticket stuck under the windshield wiper...

					CATES
			Son of a bitch.

	Shoves the ticket in his coat pocket, gets into the Caddie
	puts the scarf around the rear view mirror, starts the engine
	and guns away...

	CITY STREET

	Cates driving the convertible; he comes down a hill and turns
	toward the East Bay...

	TRANSITION.

	GOLDEN GATE PARK - MORNING

	Henry Wong, seated on a park bench. Now very dead, a bullet
	hole in the middle of his forehead. Billy Bear is seated next
	to him on the bench reading the race form.

	GANZ

	Using the telephone at an outdoor booth a few feet beyond the
	bench.

	STREET - BROADWAY DISTRICT - DAY

	LUTHER and ROSALIE, a young couple, turn a corner.  A dark
	parody of all-American young marrieds.  They are bickering as
	usual.

					ROSALIE
			I liked that carpet we saw.

					LUTHER
			We can&#39;t afford it.

					ROSALIE
			Don&#39;t remind me.

					LUTHER

			Whaddya want?  I thought you were
			locked up-

					GANZ
			I want the money, asshole, what do
			you think?  The money that Reggie
			hid...

					LUTHER
			I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talkin&#39;
			about.

					GANZ
			You want that Indian to snap her
			neck?

	He mimes the gesture... snap...

					GANZ
					 (continuing)
			Instead of worryin&#39; about Reggie,
			you better worry about me...

					LUTHER
			Don&#39;t give me this, we were
			partners.

					GANZ
			Billy, go ahead, break it...

					LUTHER
			No! Don&#39;t kill her.  I can get you
			the money.

					GANZ
			When?

					LUTHER
			I can&#39;t get it until Monday.
			Honest.

					GANZ
			You chickenshit punk...

					LUTHER
			Honest. The place we stashed it
			opens Monday morning. I can&#39;t get
			it till then. Monday morning,
			that&#39;s when it opens. After that,
			I&#39;ll get the money to you right
			away...

	Ganz finally takes the gun from the neck.

					GANZ
			I always liked you, Luther. You
			were always a lotta fun to hang
			out with...

	Rosalie is rubbing her neck now that she&#39;s been released...
	Ganz gestures to Billy.

					GANZ
					 (continuing)
			We&#39;re gonna keep her.

	Luther desperately doesn&#39;t like this.

					LUTHER
			Come on, you can trust me. Please.

					GANZ
			You try to mess with us or go to
			the cops, I promise you, I&#39;ll put
			holes in her you wouldn&#39;t believe.

	He smiles at Luther, pinches him on the cheek, shoves him out
	of the car.

	LUTHER

	Stands shivering as it powers away.

	WALDEN HOTEL - DAY

	A small hotel on one of the quiet streets behind Union Square.

	A GREEN COUGAR

	Pulls up across the street.

	INT. CAR

	Tha car arrives in front of the hotel.

					GANZ
			Nice place, huh?

	Rosalie is very nervous.

					ROSALIE
			What are you gonna do to me in
			there?

	Ganz gives her a casual smile.

					GANZ
			Maybe that&#39;s where I&#39;m gonna cut
			your throat.

					BILLY
			He&#39;s just kiddin&#39;, you just keep
			doin&#39; what I tell ya, you&#39;ll be
			okay.

	They move out of the car, head for the hotel.

	LOBBY

	A FRIZZY YOUNG BLONDE sits behind the desk in a mirrored
	entrance hall.  She reads a lurid paperback. Morning traffic
	streams by outside as Ganz, Billy and Rosalie enter and
	approach the desk.

					GANZ
			We need some rooms for a couple of
			nights...Okay?

	She smiles at Ganz.

					FRIZZY
			Sure.  We don&#39;t get many real
			customers, ya know?  Most people
			only stay an hour or two...

	Passes a form across. Ganz signs it, Frizzy glances at his
	signature then takes a key from the rack behind.

					GANZ
			I want her young.  And tall. Nice
			legs. Legs are important. Then,
			real thin.  Yeah.  NO jeans-A
			dress? a nice summer dress.  You
			know I want her fresh... I&#39;ll tell
			you why, because I been hoein&#39;
			weeds and makin&#39; license plates
			for a couple of years... Yeah, I
			know you don&#39;t get it...

	BILLY BEAR

	Sees a couple approaching, he shoves the dead man down on the
	bench and spreads the newspaper over his head.  The body now
	looking like a typical park bum who has spent the night.
	Billy walks over to Ganz.

					BILLY
			Hey, what about me?

					GANZ
			And I need one more for my pal.
			Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not
			a turban, you know, a squaw.

	Billy smiles, takes the Polaroid...

	POLAROID

	A close shot of the dead man with the bullet hole in his
	forehead.

	GANZ

	Takes the photograph back from Billy and slips it into his
	jacket pocket...

					GANZ
			Walden Hotel. Third near Broadway.
			Tell them to ask for ... uh...

	He takes the hot credit cards out of his pocket, the name
	embossed on the plastic..

					GANZ
					 (continuing)
			G.P. Polson...P.O.L.S.O.N....Just
			be a couple of hours.

	Hangs up. The two men head for a green Plymouth...

	TRANSITION.

					FRIZZY
			Number twenty-seven, Mr. Polson.

					GANZ
			Put them next door, okay.

	She gives him a slightly knowing look.

					FRIZZY
			Sure, hey, you got the whole floor
			to yourself...

	Ganz sends her back a sharp look.

					GANZ
			Keep your filthy ideas to
			yourself, lady.

	Ganz picks up his suitcase, walks over to the nearest
	stairwell.  Billy and Rosalie follow...

	TRANSITION.

	STREET

	Bars starting to fill up with mid-day customers... A black
	Chevy cruises past and stops further up the block. Two
	Plainclothesmen, VANZANT and ALGREN, get out of the car. As
	they start toward the Walden...

	THE CADILLAC CONVERTIBLE

	Pulls up near the two men. Cates climbs out of his car and
	walks over to them.

					CATES
			Hey, fellas, what&#39;s happening?
			Radio said you guys had something
			on...

					ALGREN
			Not much, Jack ... Salesman named
			Polson had his credit cards
			lifted...

	Algren nods over to the parking lot opposite.

					ALGREN
					 (continuing)
			One of Polson&#39;s cards rented that
			green coupe.

					VANZANT
			Not too much for a big rough tough
			gunfighter like you to do on this
			one...

	Cates smiles at the verbal positioning he&#39;s used to with his
	colleagues.

					CATES
			Suspect packed or is this a
			laugher?

					ALGREN
			Five and dime stuff. Polson said
			a kid with a switchblade mugged
			him and drove off on a motorcyle.

					CATES
			Yeah, well, I guess you two are
			experts at taking boy scout knives
			away from teenagers...

					VANZANT
			Yeah, we are, that means you can
			stay outta this one. We don&#39;t have
			any big need for the artillery

	Vanzant&#39;s turn to smile.

					CATES
			Hey, I&#39;m just offering to help
			out... I like to watch real pros
			work.

					VANZANT
			Help, huh?  Sometimes your kind of
			help tends to leave the suspect in
			bad shape.

	Algren...mediator... soothes the competitive situation.

					ALGREN
			Hey, relax ... Jack, you wanna
			come inside, fine... You can stake
			out the lobby...

	Cates, a bit disgusted at the politics of this moment, nods...

					CATES
			Fine, it&#39;s your show...

	The three men move toward the Walden.

	WALDEN HOTEL LOBBY

	Frizzy Blonde still behind the desk. Still reading the lurid
	paperback. Unaware as Vanzant and Algren approach... She
	looks up as they flash their badges.

					FRIZZY
			Aw, you guys were in last week.
			You better ask around.  I&#39;m not
			supposed to be hassled... I got
			friends.

					VANZANT
			Hey, park the tongue for a second,
			sweetpants, we just want to search
			a room.

					FRIZZY
			Not unless you got a warrant.

					CATES
			Maybe you should of been a lawyer
			instead of a dumb skirt workin&#39;
			behind a register.

	Frizzy turns to find Cates standing beside her. He nudges her
	aside. Starts going throught the register book.

					FRIZZY
			Aw, come on, what the shit is this?

					ALGREN
			We&#39;re looking for a guy going
			under the name Polson...

	Frizzy sits back down in defeat.

					FRIZZY
			Okay, big deal.  Get it over with.

	Cates finds the name.

					CATES
			Mr. Polson, room 27...

					ALGREN
			Is he alone?

					FRIZZY
			Naw, his sister went up an hour
			ago.

	Vanzant turns to Cates.

					VANZANT
			Okay, like we said, you stake out
			the lobby.

					CATES
			Sure. Great. Whatever.

					VANZANT
			You&#39;re not missing out on
			Dillinger. This punk just stole
			some credit cards.

	Cates watches the two Detectives head for the elevator.

	SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR

	Vanzant and Algren move down the hallwayStop at the far end.
	Both Detectives draw their pistols and approach a door.

	ROOM

	Summer dress and undergarments scatteredon the floor. LISA,
	lies naked under the covers.

	She matches Ganz&#39;s earlier requirements.Smoking a cigarette,
	staring at the ceiling. Ganz remains on top of the blanket.
	Still in his shirt and pants watching TV. Three sharp knocks
	at the door. Ganz reacts as if he&#39;s received an electric
	shock. His hand goes under the pillow... Comes up with an
	automatic. Shoves it hard into Lisa&#39;s stomach.

					LISA
			Hey...

					GANZ
			Shut up.

					LISA
			What the hell&#39;s wrong?  I didn&#39;t
			do anything.

	Another knock. Ganz makes her move to the door.

					LISA
					 (continuing)
			What do you want?  What&#39;s goin&#39; on?

					GANZ
			Shut up.

	She grabs her dress and tries to pull it on.

					GANZ
					 (continuing)
			Now ask who it is.

	Shoves harder with the pistol.

					GANZ
					 (continuing)
			Come on, ask.

	She calls out.

					LISA
			Who is it?

	CORRIDOR

	Vanzant and Algren stand back from the door. Guns held ready.

					ALGREN
			Police... open up.

	R00M

	Lisa looks from the door back to Ganz. Then at the gun held
	against her. She&#39;s petrified.

					GANZ
			Stall.

					LISA
			What do you want?

					VANZANT
			Police business. Come on, open up.

	A smile on Ganz&#39; face. Almost as if he&#39;s enjoying the moment.

					GANZ
			Keep stallin&#39;.

					LISA
			Alright, I&#39;m coming...hold on.

	I&#39;ll just be a minute.

	CORRIDOR

	Vanzant and Algren waiting. Sounds of movement from within
	the room.

	LOBBY

	Cates moves toward the foot of the stairwell. Looks across at
	mirror on the wall opposite. The entire lobby covered from
	this spot. Every angle, including Frizzy.

	ROOM

	Ganz gestures to Lisa.

					LISA
			Just a second.

	Ganz belts her with his gun; she falls..Ganz goes through the
	connecting door. Slips into the adjacent room.

	BILLY&#39;S ROOM

	Another Hooker cowers in the corner, pulling on her clothes.
	She&#39;s a Mexican girl in a ridiculous &#39;Indian&#39; outfit.

					MEXICAN GIRL
			Que paso? Que esta pasando? No
			entiendo...

					BILLY
			Shut up.

	Billy goes to where Rosalie is awkwardlytied to a chair with
	an electric dord.  He pulls her to her feet as Ganz moves by.

					BILLY
					 (continuing)
			When I say jump, girl, you better
			jump.

					BILLY
					 (continuing)

	CORRIDOR

	Vanzant reaches down, tries the knob.  Locked. Algren moves
	back, preparing to kick the door down.

	ADJACENT ROOM

	Ganz opens the door behind the two cops. Raises his pistol
	and fires. Billy&#39;s shots follow immediately. Hits Vanzant.
	Algren rolls just as Ganz fires again. Wounded, he gets off
	three shots, then moves inside Ganz&#39; room. Ganz and Billy run
	for the elevator... Exchange two more shots with Algren. The
	Mexican Girl begins screaming in Spanish...

	LOBBY

	Cates draws his .44. Races up the stairs three at a time.
	Frizzy starts to frantically call the police.

	CORRIDOR

	Cates stops at the landing. Vanzant&#39;s body sprawled across
	the hallway. Algren back in the corridor, still losing
	blood... Leans against the wall for support... Lisa staggers
	out of the room, screams. Algren points the gun toward the
	elevator. Indicating where Ganz and Billy have just fled.
	Cates starts back down toward the lobby.

	ELEVATOR

	Ganz and Billy, guns ready as the carriage jolts downward.
	Rosalie is terrified, sobbing...

	CATES

	Arrives at the halfway turn of the second staircase. He takes
	the next flight in two jumps.

	ELEVATOR

	As the doors open, Ganz gestures for Billy and Rosalie to
	wait as he heads for the lobby.

	LOBBY

	Cates literally flies into the lobby just as Ganz appears. He
	slams Ganz against a column, belts him across the neck with
	his pistol. Ganz screams with pain, drops his gun... Cates
	again slams him with his pistol, felling him...

	GANZ

	Slides across the floor.

	CATES Senses something ... moves just as Billy appears behind
	and fires at him. The bullet takes out a window. Cates dives
	over the desk. Another bullet chews up the wood.

	LOBBY

	Frizzy has been standing beside her desk, screaming... Cates&#39;
	move and the accompanying bulletspanic her. She dashes for
	safety... Cates gets to his feet behind cover. Sees Billy
	holding Rosalie by the throat. Frizzy begins to scream.

					GANZ
			He&#39;ll blow her goddamn head off.

	Cates doesn&#39;t miss a beat. He slowly levels his .44. Takes
	careful aim and starts to fire at Billy.

					ROSALIE
			No. No.

	Cates&#39; shot narrowly misses Rosalie. The bullet smashes into
	a mirror above Billy&#39;s head. Cates keeps moving closer, gun
	pointed straight ahead. Billy pushes the pistol against
	Rosalie&#39;temple. For the first time, Cates hesitates. They
	face each other across the length of the lobby.

	ALGREN

	Struggles down the remaining steps into the lobby. He still
	holds his revolver. Dares not raise it towards Billy and
	Rosalie.

	BILLY BEAR

	Covers Algren from near the entrance.  He&#39;s confused, doesn&#39;t
	know what to do... He keeps hold of Rosalie.

	GANZ

	His eyes catch Algren&#39;s...

					GANZ
			You.  Drop it and we won&#39;t kill
			her.

	Algren tosses his gun to the floor.

					GANZ
					 (continuing)
			Now, tell him to drop his Goddamn
			piece.

					ALGREN
			Do it, Cates.

	No response.

					ALGREN
					 (continuing)
			Do it, Cates.  Goddamn it, do it.

	Cates lowers his gun. Finally lets it drop to the floor.

					GANZ
			Kick it over here.

	Cates does; Ganz picks it up, smiles, looks at Billy.

					GANZ
					 (continuing)
			Get the car.

	Then back to Cates as Billy runs out the entrance with
	Rosalie.

					GANZ
					 (continuing)
			Your gun&#39;s just like mine.

	He&#39;s going to kill Cates. But first be glances at Algren.
	Then, almost casually, shoots him twice with Cates&#39; .44.
	Algren staggers back. Dead before he hits the floor. Cates
	twists sideways just as Ganz fires. The bullet misses. Again
	Frizzy starts screaming and struggling. Ganz swipes the woman
	across the head with the gun. Her body slumps to the floor.
	Police sirens can be heard in the distance. Cates makes an
	attempt for Algren&#39;s gun. A bullet splatters against the
	floor only inches from his outstretched fingers. The gun
	skitters out of reach.

					CATES
			You lying son of a bitch...

					GANZ
			What are you talking about? We
			didn&#39;t kill her ...

	Ganz smiles.

	With your own gun, cop. How does it feel? Cates leaps into a
	wooden phone booth. Ganz leisurely blasts away at the booth
	with both his and Cates&#39; gun. Two bullets crash into the
	booth. Ganz moves to check inside the booth but sirens are
	ominously near. Ganz finally retreats out the entrance.

	STREET

	Billy and Rosalie weave their way across street to the
	Cougar. They make a U-turn. Ganz runs out. Car pulls out,
	then the police cars and vans begin to arrive.

	PHONE BOOTH

	Chunks of wood on the floor. Shafts of light through a dozen
	bullet holes. Shattered receiver dangling from a cord. Cates,
	wedged tight into the very top of the cubicle. He drops to
	the floor.

	LOBBY

	The police arrive. Swarm into the hotel. All eyes on Cates as
	he rushes to Algren. Too late... Cates realizes Algren is
	dead. He cradles Algren&#39;s head as he stares at the arriving
	TAC Squad and Patrolmen.

	TRANSITION.

	SQUAD ROOM DAY

	Cates walks in. Several Detectives gather around him.

					FAT COP
			What happened?

					CATES
			Read the report.

					OLD COP
			Two cops blown away by a credit
			card booster... that don&#39;t figure.

					CATES
			No shit.

					FAT COP
			They were good cops.

					CATES
			They were good cops who fucked up
			and got careless.

	A snotty YOUNG COP paces.

					YOUNG COP
			That&#39;s what you say, Cates...

					CATES
			Yeah.

					YOUNG COP
			But that&#39;s what you say about all
			of us all the tine ... we&#39;re
			always the ones fucking up when
			you tell it...

					CATES
			The truth hurts, doesn&#39;t it, buddy?

	Cates looks at the Old Cop.

					OLD COP
			It don&#39;t figure.

					CATES
			I need to borrow a piece.

	The OLD COP shrugs... looks in his desk...

					YOUNG COP
			Somebody steals your gun, you&#39;re
			supposed to file a report.

					CATES
			Are you gonna tell me about police
			procedure?  Do me a favor, don&#39;t
			give me a bunch of crap.

					YOUNG COP
			I guess when two cops die on
			account of your fuck up you want
			to keep it as quiet as possible...

	Cates loses it for a second, lands on him with both hands,
	pushes him against a wall... The room goes quiet. Cates cools
	down.

					CATES
			Just shut the fuck up.

	The other cops don&#39;t intervene. They just watch.  Cates cools
	down, straightens up. HADEN walks by, or, rather, speeds by.

					HADEN
			Cates, I&#39;ll need to see you in
			five minutes, exactly five.

	The Old Cop hands Cates a gun, a traditional Army .45...

					OLD COP
			Best I can do.

					HADEN
			D&#39;you read me, Cates...

	Haden continues moving away.

					CATES
			Five minutes.  I heard you, your
			voice carries...

	As Cates is examining the gun, RUTH, a lab technician, enters
	and drops three 8 x 10&#39;s on the desk near Cates.

					RUTH
			They&#39;re still wet.

	Cates lifts the blow-ups, each one showing a different aspect
	of a spent bullet.

					RUTH
					 (continuing)
			Lots of people getting shot with
			.44&#39;s lately ... Last year, it was
			Saturday Night Specials..now it&#39;s
			heavy stuff. People must be
			getting madder about something.

	Cates starts pinning the blow-ups onto a large bulletin board
	on the wall. Nearby, at the same time (within Cates&#39; line of
	sight, within earshot), Lisa, the Hooker, is being
	interrogated by a POLICE-WOMAN who pulls the statement off
	the typewriter. Nearby, the Indian Hooker is being
	interrogated in Spanish.

					POLICEWOMAN
			You&#39;re an accessory to Murder One,
			so you&#39;re going to have to do a
			whole lot better than what we got
			down here, honey...

					LISA
			Gimme a break, huh? ... Look, I
			got there.  He was a trick just
			like any other for all I knew.
			That&#39;s all there is.  He didn&#39;t
			feel like sitting and talking. He
			was in a big hurry to get laid.
			I was with him about an hour...

	Cates has gotten interested in the last part of this ...
	drifts toward her... A DETECTIVE comes through, begins
	distributing I.B.M. printouts to Cates, the other nearby
	officers..

					DETECTIVE
			We got a print from the hotel
			room.  Guy&#39;s real name is Ganz,
			Albert Ganz.  A hitter from back
			East but he worked out here a few
			years back.  Armed robbery. Broke
			out of prison two days ago and
			capped two of the guards. A real
			animal.  Wait&#39;ll you see this...

	Cates reads the printout, then smoothly,imperiously, he takes
	over the questioning of Lisa.

					CATES
			Did he give you a return match?

					LISA
			He wasn&#39;t interested.

					CATES
			Maybe he didn&#39;t like your
			performance.

					LISA
			Fuck you.

					CATES
			I&#39;ll take a raincheck...

	From the side, Ruth is pointing at the photos...

					RUTH
			This&#39;ll interest you, Jack...we&#39;ve
			got something here from your
			gun... and these are from the
			first weapon Ganz used...

					CATES
			I don&#39;t get it.

					RUTH
			Here.

					CATES

	She turns, produces the third photo.  Pins it beside the one
	from the Walden Hotel.

					RUTH
			A perfect match for the markings
			from the first gun he used... but
			not from the Walden Hotel... fired
			at least six hours earlier...at
			point blank range... right between
			the eyes.  Found him on a park
			bench...

	She shows him two more pictures.  Police forensics shots of
	Henry Wong ... very dead on the park bench...

					RUTH
					 (continuing)
			Ya know, there are some very bad
			people out there in the world.

					CATES
			Look at it this way, Ruth.  If
			there weren&#39;t, what would there be
			for us to do?

	Lisa continues with the Policewoman.

					LISA
			Anyway... so I got there and took
			him down.  He started watching
			television and then you
			sensational people started banging
			on the door... that&#39;s all...
			except ... he&#39;s gonna give you
			guys a hard time.

					CATES

	Cates looks up as he hears that remark.  Notices KEHOE,
	another Detective, entering with a long suitcase.

					POLICEWOMAN
			What makes you think so?

					LISA
			I think he liked shooting cops a
			lot more than getting laid.

	Cates watches Kehoe unpack the box.

					CATES
			Is that what this guy Ganz had in
			the hotel?

					KEHOE
			Every last bit of it.  The big
			guy&#39;s room was empty.

					CATES
			I&#39;ll help you out.

	Cates and Kehoe start going through the suitcase.  Kehoe
	produces a speed loader for a .44...

					KEHOE
			This guy must have had a .44 like
			yours, Jack. Now he&#39;s got yours.

					CATES
			Shit.

	Kehoe next produces several boxes of shells.

					KEHOE
			This cat was real serious about
			his artillery.

	An Attendant comes through, hands Kehoe a file. He opens it,
	shows the file to Cates who reads the name under the mug shot.

					CATES
			Billy Bear...

					KEHOE
			Backup man from the East Bay.
			Worked with Ganz a few years ago
			and sprung him from the road gang.

	Kehoe opens the second file.  Four mug shots are inside.

					CATES
			Who are all these?

					KEHOE
			They all pulled a bunch of jobs
			with Ganz about four years ago.

					CATES
			Wait a minute, wait a minute...
			who&#39;s this?

					KEHOE
			Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was
			in on the same job.

	Cates spins the file around so that both Ruth an Kehoe can
	see it, throws the forensic shots down beside it.

					CATES
			Tell me that&#39;s not the same guy.

					KEHOE
			Hey ... Dick Tracy.

					RUTH
			Did Ganz have a grudge against his
			old friends?

	Haden comes out of his office.

					HADEN
			Get in here, Cates.

	Cates ignores him.

					CATES
			I think I wanna have a discussion
			about it with any of the ones
			still walking.  Can we find them?

					KEHOE
			Here&#39;s the file. Cates checks the
			file.

					CATES
			One of  em&#39;s in the slam.

					HADEN
			Damn you, Cates ... Get in here.

	Cates walks into Haden&#39;s cubicle.

					CATES
			I want to be left alone on this
			one. Algren was killed with my gun.

					HADEN
			Yeah, I read the report...

	Haden shuffles some papers, seems to ignore Cates.

					CATES
			Hey, the bastard&#39;s got my gun.  I
			want it back.

					HADEN
			Jack, come on, there is an
			official department policy about
			cop killings. Cop killers
			represent a special priority
			because any man crazy enough to
			kill a cop is a greater threat to
			an unarmed civilian... In other
			words, we can&#39;t seen like we&#39;re in
			the revenge business... I know, we
			all know the truth&#39;s a little
			different.

	Cates almost smiles at Haden.

					CATES
			Yeah...

					HADEN
			Anthing botherin&#39; you besides
			losin&#39; your gun?

					CATES
			Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get
			hurt while I&#39;m makin&#39; a play. I
			don&#39;t like it.

					HADEN
			You might be more of a team player
			and a little less of a hot dog on
			this one, Jack.

					CATES
			Being a hot dog&#39;s worked pretty
			well for me so far... Besides, I
			got a lead...

					HADEN
			Okay.  You&#39;re not a team player.
			You gotta do things your own way.
			Fine.  Nail this guy and make us
			all look good.  But you better
			watch your ass.  If you screw up,
			I can promise you, you&#39;re goin&#39;
			down.

					CATES
			You really know how to send a guy
			out with a great attitude. He
			starts to go.

					HADEN
			Jack?

					CATES
			Yeah?

					HADEN
			Try not to get your ass shot to
			pieces. We got enough dead cops on
			this one.

					CATES
			I&#39;ll keep it in mind.

	Leaves.

	TRANSITION.

	Heavy vehicle and pedestrian traffic. Cates stands near a hot
	dog stand. Elaine joins him. Cates is eating a hot dog and
	studying a police file.

					ELAINE
			Great place for lunch.

					CATES
			Yeah, one of my favorites.

					ELAINE
			You made the front page.

	He hands her a dog.

					CATES
			Yeah, Guess it must have been a
			slow news day...

					ELAINE
			Jack, are you okay?

					CATES
			Sure, okay, fine, no problem...
			See, there&#39;s this kid in jail ...
			First thing I got to do is go up
			and see what he knows ...

	He points to the file.

					ELAINE
			I thought you might come over to
			my place to recuperate.  I don&#39;t
			have to go to work until the day
			after tomorrow.

	They begin to stroll down the street.

					CATES
			I got nothing to recuperate from.
			There&#39;s a guy out there with my
			gun, and I want it back.

	She&#39;s not happy with this attitude.

					ELAINE
			Look, spare me the macho bullshit
			about your gun...

					CATES
			Bullshit?  I&#39;ll tell you about
			bullshit.  My gun&#39;s a real weapon
			in the hands of a real maniac who
			knows how to use it.  It isn&#39;t my
			macho bullshit that&#39;s killing
			people, my gun is ...

					ELAINE
			Look, Jack, if you make everything
			your personal responsibility,
			you&#39;ll turn into a bad cop.  It&#39;s
			not a practical way to function...

					CATES
			I didn&#39;t get burned, two cops did.
			Listen, I&#39;ll tell you about
			personnel responsibility.  I like
			to get the job done right.  And if
			I don&#39;t get my job done right...
			I&#39;m for shit.

					ELAINE
			Here it comes again ... the sacred
			job...

					CATES
			That&#39;s right.  I&#39;m not like you.
			I&#39;m not gonna sit on my ass
			wondering what&#39;s right and what&#39;s
			wrong... There&#39;s a psycho out
			there killing people with my gun
			and I&#39;m gonna get him.  Because
			it&#39;s my job. And if you don&#39;t get
			that...

					ELAINE
			I get that. The job first.
			Everything else, especially me,
			second. I get it. I don&#39;t like it.

	Pause.

					CATES
			No one asked you to like it... But
			that&#39;s the way it is.

	TRANSITION.

	PRISON CELL BLOCK - DAY

	Cates and a GUARD on the upper deck approaching the door to
	the cell block... The Guard shouts upward.

					GUARD
			Open Nine.

	With a huge metal clatters the door to the cell block opens.

	CELL BLOCK - NEAR ENTRANCE

	Cates and the Guard go through the door.

					GUARD
			Close Nine.

	They move forward together.

					GUARD
					 (continuing)
			It&#39;s Number Twenty-two... You want
			company?

					CATES
			No, no thanks.

	The Guard shrugs, stays by the door.

	CATES

	He walks down the cell block. Inmates stare at him from
	inside the stark cells. They don&#39;t know who he is, but they
	can smell a cop. Cates stops at Twenty-two, looks inside...
	a bit startled. Obviously, Reggie Hammond has connections and
	taste. The paint is fresh; there&#39;s framed prints on the wall
	instead of pin-ups, and the overall feeling is that of a
	graduate school dorm rather than a prison. Cates turns, nods
	to the Guard at the end of the cell block. He throws a switch
	and the door opens.

	HAMMOND&#39;S CELL

	Cates steps inside. Hammond is at a table wearing a Sony
	Walkman and writing in some detailed ledgers with a fountain
	pen. He&#39;s boogeying in his seat to the music. Sprawled on a
	bunk nearby is LEROY, another black inmate close to Hammond&#39;s
	age. Leroy is leafing through a copy of a skin magazine. He
	doesn&#39;t even look at Cates.

					CATES
			Hammond.

	Cates steps inside the cell.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			Hammond!

	No answer. Cates leans over, hits the override button on the
	Sony.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			Hammond!

	Hammond jumps, grabs his ears in pain ... He pulls the
	headset off and glares at Cates.

					HAMMOND
			You got a name, cop?

					CATES
			Try Cates.  And let&#39;s talk in
			private, okay?

					HAMMOND
			Sure, anything you want.

	He tosses the Walkman to Leroy who dutifully puts it on.

					CATES
			Look, convict, I know all about
			you. Single.  No fixed address. No
			known relatives.

			One previous conviction. Armed
			robbery... six months to go on a
			three-year sentence.

					HAMMOND
			You here to write my life story?

					CATES
			Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just
			need some help.

	Cates takes the forensic photo out of his pocket, passes it
	across the table to Hammond.  He looks at it, hardly reacts.

					HAMMOND
			Henry Wong... My old pal.  He&#39;s
			looked better...

	He passes the photo back.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			Look, I got just six months before
			gettin&#39; out of here.  Six months
			between me and freedom after bein&#39;
			here three years... And I&#39;m not
			gonna do anything to screw it up,
			includin&#39; pee in the prison yard,
			knock up the Warden&#39;s daughter or
			rat on my old partners...

	Cates swings the cell door back open.

					CATES
			Too bad, Reggie.  I thought maybe
			you were a smart boy.  But I guess
			if you were real smart you
			wouldn&#39;t be a convict.

	He smiles, decides to play his card.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			I can see a second-rater like you
			wouldn&#39;t be any help at all goin&#39;
			up against a real hard case like
			Ganz.

	Hammond jerks his head around.

					HAMMOND
			Ganz?

	Pause.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			Ganz the one who shot Henry?
			Cates, I asked you a question...

	Cates smiles.

					CATES
			Yeah, I noticed...

					HAMMOND
			Ganz is in jail.  He&#39;s gonna be
			there two years after I&#39;m on the
			street.

					CATES
			Didn&#39;t work out that way.  He
			busted out with a big Indian.
			They capped two guards on a road
			gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.

	He turns, goes out. The door clangs behind him. Hammond jumps
	up and bangs on the bars, shouts at Cates&#39; back...

					HAMMOND
			Cates, Come back here.

	Cates turns, saunters back, leans against the door.

					CATES
			Yeah?

					HAMMOND
			I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta
			get me outta here first.

					CATES
			You&#39;re crazy.

					HAMMOND
			I can help you, man, but you gotta
			get me out.  I got to be on the
			street.  Get me outta here.

					CATES
			What&#39;s the big deal about you
			bein&#39; on the street?

					HAMMOND
			I got a lot to protect.

					CATES
			Bullshit.

					HAMMOND
			It&#39;s the only way you&#39;re gonna get
			Ganz.

					CATES
			I&#39;ll think about it.

	TRANSITION.

	Cates typing several of official looking documents while
	seated across from a rather dour-looking bureaucrat named BOB.

					CATES
			Let me borrow your pen, Bob.

	Handed over by Bob.

					BOB
			You going to use your own name?

					CATES
			Shit, no.

					CANDY

	He begins signing the documents.

					BOB
			Jack, just remember one thing. If
			all this comes down, you don&#39;t
			know me.  I&#39;m not gonna burn for
			you.  And I&#39;ll tell you something
			else.  If it all comes down, your
			ass is new-mown grass.

					CATES
			Right.  Hey, no sweat.

	He hands over the papers. Smiles.

					BOB
			BOB You got him for 48 hours.

	Bob studies the sheet.

					BOB
					 (continuing)
			You got a big career as a forger
			if you decide to go that way,
			Jack...   I&#39;ll ring security.

	TRANSITION.

	PROCESS ROOM - PRISON - DAY

	The GUARD leads Hammond to a steel cage. Harmnond&#39;s now
	wearing a beautifully tailored plaid suit.

	The Guard shouts to ANOTHER GUARD on the far side.

					GUARD
			Prisoner G21355 ... Hammond.

					SECOND GUARD
			Okay.  Send him through.

	The gate slides open. The Guard geztures for Hairmond to
	enter. Hammond walks to the far side of the pen.  The first
	gate closes, the second one opens.

	Hammond turns and walks over to Cates. The Guard comes up to
	Cates, double checks his orders then unlocks Hammond&#39;s cuffs.

					GUARD
			Gotta sign for him.

					CATES
			Sure thing...

	He looks over at Hammond who smiles at him.  Then looks at
	Harmond&#39;s clothes...

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			This prison gives out $400 suits?

					HAMMOND
			What are you talkin&#39; about?  This
			suit&#39;s mine.  It cost $900.

	Hammond dusts off a sleeve.

					CATES
			We&#39;re supposed to be after a
			killer, not a string of hookers...

					HAMMOND
			Listen, it may be a little out of
			date. You know, I got a reputation
			for lookingreal sharp with the
			ladies...

	Cates hands some papers to the Guard.

					GUARD
			He&#39;s all yours.

	The Guard walks away as Hammond feels Cates&#39; lapel.

					HAMMOND
			We could change this for something
			good...Get you lookin&#39; sharp for
			pussy.

	Cates gives him a look.

					CATES
			I don&#39;t need to hear your jive. I
			already got that department taken
			care of...

					HAMMOND
			You got a girl... shit... the
			generosityof women never ceases to
			amaze me.

	Cates slaps a cuff on Hammond&#39;s outstrethand, then puts the
	other on his own wrist.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			Hey, no way.  Take off the
			bracelets or no deal.

					CATES
			You just don&#39;t get it, do your
			Reggie?  There isn&#39;t any deal. I
			own your ass.

					HAMMOND
			No way to start a partnership.

					CATES
			Get this.  We ain&#39;t partners. We
			ain&#39;t brothers.  We ain&#39;t friends.
			I&#39;m puttin&#39; you down and keepin&#39;
			you down until Ganz is locked up
			or dead.  And if Ganz gets away,
			you&#39;re gonna be sorry we ever met.

					HAMMOND
			Shit.  I&#39;m already sorry.

	Cates yanks on the cuffs.  They move away.

					?
			TRANSITION.

	OUTSIDE THE JAIL - DAY

	CATES LEADS HAMMOND OUT.  THEY HEAD FOR CATES&#39; BATTERED
	CADILLAC.

					HAMMOND
			This your car, man?

					CATES
			Yeah.

					HAMMOND
			It looks like you bought it off
			one of the brothers.

	As they approach the car...

					CATES
			Okay, let&#39;s get down to it.  I did
			my part and got you out.  So now
			you tell me where we&#39;re goin&#39;?

					HAMMOND
			Don&#39;t worry, I got a move for ya.
			An awesome move. A guy named
			Luther. Ganz&#39;ll be paying him a
			visit.  We go to him right away.

					CATES
			Luther was part of the gang?

					HAMMOND
			What gang you talkin&#39; about, Jack?

					CATES
			I can read a police file,
			shithead, and quit calling me Jack.

					HAMMOND
			Just an expression man, don&#39;t mean
			nothin&#39;.

	Cates gets behind the wheel and kicks the engine over.

					CATES
			I don&#39;t give a damn.  It happens
			to be my name.

					HAMMOND
			Then what&#39;re you complainin&#39;
			about? At least nobody&#39;s calling
			you shithead....

					CATES
			I may call you worse than that.

	Cates drives off.

	EXT. STREET - MISSION DISTRICT - DAY

	Cates&#39; Cadillac purrs into view, entering a deserted street
	within a rundown neighborhood.

	INT. CADDY

	Hammond seated next to Cates.

					HAMMOND
			Just up the street, the other
			side, over there ... Now, don&#39;t
			bother knockin&#39; on the door.
			Luther ain&#39;t the kind of guy that
			looks for company.

					CATES
			Your pal nuts enough to take a
			shot at me?

					HAMMOND
			Luther ain&#39;t the reliable type. I
			don&#39;t want you shot yet, Cates ...
			not before you been a help to me.

					CATES
			I&#39;m helpin&#39; you, huh?

	Hammond smiles.

					HAMMOND
			Yeah. Didn&#39;t you know that?

	STREET

	The Caddy pulls to a stop.

					HAMMOND
			Over there...232...

	Cates double-checks his .38.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			You better let me borrow one of
			those.

	Cates smiles.

					CATES
			Sure thing, asshole.

	Handcuffs Hammond to the door handle.  Grabs the car keys.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			You just hang on.  And hope this
			big move of yours turns out to be
			something. Opens the car door.

					CATES
					 (continuing)

	LUTHER&#39;S VICTORIAN

	Cates knocks at the door. Nothing. Knocks again ... no
	response.. From inside, he hears a faint noise but no
	response to the knock. Holding the .38 in one hand, Cates
	tries the knob with the other. The door opens. Cautiously,
	Cates steps inside.

	INT. LUTHER&#39;S VICTORIAN

	Long corridor ahead. No sign of Luther.

	CATES

	Moves down the corriaor, checks the rooms off to one sides.

	LUTHER LUTHER

	slips into the hallway behind Cates... Cates turns just as he
	gets to the kitchen. Luther holds a gun. Cates drops to a
	crouch and aims the .38. Luther whirls and fires at Cates. As
	wood and plaster fly out all round him, Cates makes a running
	dive for the floor. Luther runs out before Cates has
	regainehis feet.

	STREET

	Luther rushes out the front door and heads toward the
	Cadillac.

	HAMMOND

	Watches as Luther heads down the sidewaltoward him. As he
	starts to pass by... Hammond steps out suddenly... Flattens
	him with the car door. Luther drops, stunned. Hammond, still
	restricted by being cuffed to the door handle, reaches and
	grabs his pistol.

					CATES
			Hammond, Drop the Goddamn gun.

	Hammond looks up. He sprints across the pavement. Aims his
	gun at Hammond.

					HAMMOND
			Quit playin&#39; cop and undo this
			cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this
			man.

					CATES
			I&#39;m tellin&#39; you to drop the Goddam
			gun.

					HAMMOND
			I got a whole thing about people
			pointin&#39; guns at me.

					CATES
			Just throw me the Goddamn gun.

	Long moment. Then Hammond smiles and tosses him Luther&#39;s
	pistol.  Luther groans. Cates puts his foot on Luther&#39;s belly
	and pulls himself into a standing position, cuffs him.

					HAMMOND
			Luther, I always told you the
			physical side of life wasn&#39;t your
			gig.  Look at you, all messed
			up... Course you never were much
			in the snappy dresser department,
			were you?

	Cates now has Luther ready to be questioned.

					CATES
			Come on, talk to him.

	Hammond turns to smile at Luther.

					HAMMOND
			What&#39;s happening, Luther?

					LUTHER
			I thought you were inside...

					HAMMOND
			Meet my travel Agent.

	Luther leans forward, looks straight at Cates.

					LUTHER
			A cop...

					CATES
			I sure ain&#39;t his fairy
			godmother... now I&#39;m looking for
			Ganz...where is he?

					LUTHER
			Haven&#39;t seen him for years. That&#39;s
			the truth.

					CATES
			You just took a shot at me,
			asshole. I think you do know where
			he is.

					LUTHER
			Who gives a fuck what you think?

	Cates grabs the still open Cadillac door, slams it into
	Luther. He falls backwards. Cates looks at Hammond.

					CATES
			Hey, this works pretty good.

					HAMMOND
			Thank you.

					CATES
			Want to try it again?

	Luther sits up again, glares at Cates.

					LUTHER
			Ganz and Billy got my girl,
			Rosalie.

					CATES
			I think I met her.  Now tell us
			something we don&#39;t know, like
			where they stashed her.

					LUTHER
			I don&#39;t know.

	Cates slams the car door agains him again.

					HAMMOND
			I gotta tell you he&#39;s having a
			ball with this car door, Luther...
			You&#39;d better think of somethin&#39; to
			tell him.

	Luther besitates...flashes a look at Hammond, who sends him
	a silent fleeting reply.  Maybe Cates sees this. Maybe not.

					LUTHER
			He ... he wants me to help him
			skip town.

					CATES
			When? How?

					LUTHER
			I dunno ... he&#39;s gonna call me...

	Another look at Hammond.

					LUTHER
					 (continuing)
			He&#39;s gonna call me on...Tuesday.

	Something&#39;s wrong with all this.  Cates isn&#39;t sure just what.
	Not yet. He looks at Hammond.

					CATES
			What do you think?

					HAMMOND
			I think you better put him on ice,
			man.

					CATES
			He&#39;s gotta take that call ... if
			there is one.

					HAMMOND
			If you let him run around till
			Tuesday, he&#39;s gonna run right to
			Ganz and warn him. Ain&#39;t you,
			motherfucker?

	Luther makes a play toward Hammond, who laughs, doesn&#39;t even
	flinch.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			Luther, are you angry with me?

	Cates wrestles Luther into the back seat, turns to Hammond.

					CATES
			I don&#39;t know what the hell you&#39;re
			smiling about, watermelon. Your
			big move turned out to be shit.

	HAMMOND Just stares at Cates, keeps smiling...

	TRANSITION.

	BOOKING - POLICE PRECINCT - NIGHT

	Two Uniforms follow a sullen Luther, Cates and Hammond to the
	DUTY SERGEANT... Cates speaks to him through the small
	window.

					CATES
			Assault on a police officer with
			a deadly weapon.  Carrying a
			concealed weapon.  Resisting
			arrest, Disturbing the peace.
			Public nuisance...

	The Sergeant begins typing out an arrest form.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			I&#39;ll think up a few more and file
			the report tomorrow.

	Cates looks back at Hammond as Luther is hauled away.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			Come on, I gotta make a phone call.

	As they move through the honeycomb of office partitions.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			You stay with me.

	Cates picks up the phone on the other side of the booking
	desk. Dials ... waits for a response as TWO HOOKERS are led
	past by an Arresting Officer. Hammond gives them the eye.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			This is Jack Cates. Any messages?

	ELAINE&#39;S APARTMENT

	Elaine is on the kitchen phone, speakingwhite putting her
	coat on over her uniform for the evening.  One look at the
	way it is cut and you know why she hates her job.

					ELAINE
			Just one.  Some lady called.  Said
			she&#39;s a little hot-headed
			sometimes... But she still wants
			her occasional roommate. She&#39;d
			like to talk it over after she
			gets off work tonight... if it&#39;s
			humanly possible....

					CATES
			Elaine, look, I&#39;m in the middle of
			sone stuff right now... I&#39;m not
			gonna have time to come by. I
			don&#39;t know when I can get there.

	Her face falls. Making the offer was hard enough.

					ELAINE
			Come on, Jack ... you&#39;re making me
			work too Goddamn hard at this...

	Jack is very irritated by this turn of events.

					CATES
			Listen, Goddamn it if you think
			I&#39;m happy about it, you&#39;re nuts.
			I just gotta take care of a few
			things, okay?

					ELAINE
			This is not the way people who
			care for each other are supposed
			to behave.

	Cates says nothing.  She hangs up angrily.

	BOOKING

	Hammond is working on the girls.

					HAMMOND
			Excuse me, ladies, you seem to be
			in need of assistance.

					HOOKER TWO
			Look, we got enough problems, we
			don&#39;t need no tight-ass court-
			appointed lawyer trying to
			bullshit us!

					HAMMOND
			Sweetheart, I&#39;m not trying to
			bullshit you. I don&#39;t know whether
			or not you ladies heard but the
			city is coming down real hard on
			people practicing unlawful carnal
			knowledge.

					HOOKER ONE
			So what are you trying to say,
			fella?

					HAMMOND
			I&#39;m trying to say that you&#39;re not
			just walk in that courtroom and
			get gonna slapped with a $50 fine
			and be back on the street turning
			tricks tonight. You both are going
			to do some time. About 30 days
			each... Unless, of course,we talk
			real business.

					HOOKER TWO
			So where do you want to do it,
			honey? You wanna hop up on the
			counter?

					HAMMOND
			No, we can go to the back room.

	Cates walks over and pulls him by the shoulder.

					CATES
			We&#39;re on the move. Let&#39;s go. As
			they walk toward a corridor.

					HAMMOND
			Do you know how close I was to
			getting some trim.  And you
			fucked&#39; it up.

					CATES
			Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you.
			And I didn&#39;t get you out so you
			could go on a Goddamn &quot;trim&quot;
			hunt... stop moaning.

					HAMMOND
			Speakin&#39; of moans my Stomach is
			startin&#39; to growl.

					CATES
			We eat when I say we eat.

					HAMMOND
			Bullshit ... I ain&#39;t moving  till
			I get something to eat. You&#39;ve
			been treating me like shit ever
			since I came out here.  If you
			don&#39;t like it, you can take me
			back to the penitentiary and kiss
			my hungry black ass good-bye.  And
			I want some food some place nice..
			Some good people, nice music...

					CATES
			Yeah, I&#39;m hungry too. I know of a
			place. Let&#39;s go eat.

					HAMMOND
			Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers...
			They move off down the corridor.

	TRANSITION.

	UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	INT.  POLICE HEADQUARTERS

	Cates and Hammond at a candy machine.  Cates drops in a
	quarter, throws Hammond a candy bar...

					CATES
			There&#39;s your God-damn dinner. Now,
			let&#39;s go.

	They move toward a row of parked cars.

	AT THE CADDY

					HAMMOND
			Who&#39;d you call on the phone back
			at the booking station?

					CATES
			Just get in the car and keep your
			mouth shut.

	Hammond gets in the car as Cates readjusts Elaine&#39;s scarf on
	the mirror.

					HAMMOND
			Must of been your lady friend...

	Cates frowns at him.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			You really do have onoe, huh,
			Jack... what&#39;s her problem besides
			you?

					CATES
			She&#39;s got the same complaint as
			half the Goddamn population.  She
			can&#39;t get the job she&#39;s trained
			for and it pisses her off...
			Anyway, what the fuck do you care?

	Cates climbs in behind the wheel of the Cadillac.

					HAMMOND
			No, man, tell me about her.  In
			jail they got me surrounded by
			guys wearin&#39; blue suits twenty-
			four hours a day.  And I ain&#39;t
			built for that. Really?  With the
			clothes you got on you look like
			you&#39;d love it.

	Cates takes a belt from his flask.

					CATES
			Now, where we goin&#39;, convict?

					HAMMOND
			Mission District.  Gonna find us
			an Indian.

	Cates starts the motor, slams it into gear.  Accelerates out
	to the street.

	TRANSITION.

	EXT.  CITY STREET NIGHT

	Cates and Hammon booming along in the Caddy.

					HAMMOND
			Come on, Jack.  I want to hear
			about your girl.  When were you
			with her last ... You get what I
			mean?

	Smiles. Cates smiles back at him, almost cruelly

					CATES
			I don&#39;t give out the details.

					HAMMOND
			Last night, two nights ago, three?

	Cates keeps smiling.

					CATES
			Last night.

					HAMMOND
			You have a good time?

	Pained expression on Cates&#39; face as he comes back to reality.

					CATES
			Sure.  Then we had a fight this
			morning.

					HAMMOND
			At least you took care of business
			and got the important part in
			before she came down on you...Tell
			me a little about her.  She got
			great tits?

	Cates gives him a hard look.

					CATES
			I get the feeling it&#39;s going to be
			real long night.

	They keep driving.

	TRANSITION.

	MISSION DISTRICT - STREET - NIGHT

	The Cadillac drives slowly past a bar called Torchie&#39;s.
	Stops at the end of the block.

					CATES
			Well?

					HAMMOND
			It&#39;s a long shot, but...Billy used
			to tend bar here a few years back.
			I heard him talk about it.

					CATES
			This part of town, they&#39;ll make us
			for heat the second we walk in.
			Just back me up like you&#39;ve got a
			piece...

					HAMMOND
			Back you up?  Now why would I
			wanna do that?

					CATES
			If they kick my ass, they&#39;ll sure
			as hell carve yours up...

					HAMMOND
			But you can handle it all right,
			huh? Real amazin&#39; how far a gun
			and a badge can carry some cats...

					CATES
			Bullshit.  Attitude and experience
			get you through...

	Cates and Hammond step out, glance toward the bar.

					HAMMOND
			I been in a lot of bars where a
			white cop rousted me and some of
			the brothers. All those clowns
			ever had going for &#39;em was a gun
			and a badge...

					CATES
			You need five years training to
			handle a joint like...

	Hamnond&#39;s had enough of this debate.

					HAMMOND
			Hey, you wanna bet?

					CATES
			I got two problems.  Number one,
			I&#39;m not playin&#39; games.  Number
			two, you got nothin&#39; to bet with.

					HAMMOND
			If we come outta this joint with
			Ganz&#39; phone number, or a dead
			Indian, or anything else useful,
			then you could turn the other way
			for half an hour while I get
			laid...

					CATES
			Why?  Anybody that talks about
			women as much as you do probably
			can&#39;t get it up anyway.

					HAMMOND
			That&#39;s never been one of my
			problems.

			Now, stop stallin&#39;, man, or else
			admit all this professional stuff
			you&#39;re talkin&#39; about is a crock of
			shit.

					CATES
			I&#39;ll tell you what happens if you
			lose... you tell the truth for
			once.

					HAMMOND
			What are you talkin&#39; about?

					CATES
			You tell me what Ganz busted out
			for, he&#39;s after a lot more than
			just gettin&#39; out of jail.  And
			whatever it is, you&#39;re part of it.

					HAMMOND
			I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking
			about. I just wanna see Ganz
			nailed.

					CATES
			The bet&#39;s off.

	Hammond thinks it over..

					HAMMOND
			Okay, if I lose, I&#39;ll tell you
			anything you want to know...

	Cates reaches into his pocket.

					CATES
			I&#39;m gonna enjoy this ... here,
			I&#39;ll even loan you my badge.

					HAMMOND
			I thought you said bullshit and
			experience are all it takes.

	He takes the badge anyway as they head for the entrance.

	TORCHIE&#39;S WESTERN BAR

	They step inside. Hammond reacts to...

	REDNECK CITY

	Longhorns mounted over the bar, Rebel Flags, Lone Star Beer,
	armadillo posters. Even the waitresses wear Stetsons.
	Rockabilly pounding from the jukebox. A Cowgirl Stripper is
	doing the grind on a small podium.

					HAMMOND
			This place don&#39;t seem real popular
			with the brothers.

					CATES
			My kind of place. I always liked
			country boys.

	Cates smiles, finds a table in the corner. A Cowgirl comes
	over to take his order.

	HAMMOND

	Takes a deep breath, moves toward the bar. Smiles at the good
	ol&#39; boys. They don&#39;t smile back. He sits down at the bar.

					BARTENDER
			Yeah.

					HAMMOND
			Vodka.

					BARTENDER
			Maybe you better have a Black
			Russian.

					HAMMOND
			No, man, I think I&#39;ll have a vodka.

	Hamnond looks around the room.

	THE BARTENDER

	places a glass in front of him, picks up the dollar as
	Harmond flashes Cates&#39; shield.

					HAMMOND
			You know a big Indian named Billy
			Bear?  He used to work here.

	The Bartender shakes his head, gives him a scowl.

					BARTENDER
			Never heard of him.

	Hammond lifts the shot glass and throws it through the mirror
	behind the bar. Sudden silence throughout the room.

					HAMMOND
			Now how&#39;s your memory doin&#39;?

					BARTENDER
			Fuck off.  I don&#39;t know what the
			hell you&#39;re talkin&#39; about.

					HAMMOND
			Maybe I better ask around, see
			what your pals think.

					BARTENDER
			I don&#39;t give a shit who you ask.

	The Bartender walks down toward Cates.

	HAMMOND

	Moves away from the bar. He stops at a booth occupied by

	FOUR COWBOY PUNKS,

	one a very big man.  Hammond grabs him by the arm and pulls
	him up.

					HAMMOND
			Up against the wall, cowboy.

	The Punk breaks free, aims a massive haymaker at Hammond.
	Gets a right to the stomach for his trouble.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			Now, I said get over there by that
			wall ... You hear me,
			motherfucker...

	Looks at the others.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			Move it, rednecks.  On your feet...

	He grabs the next by the arm, yanks him up.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			Over there...move your ass. Some
			of you rednecks seem a little hard
			of hearing, so I&#39;ll repeat it for
			everybody... I need word on the
			whereabouts of an Indian that goes
			by the name of Billy Bear. It&#39;s a
			police matter and you all look
			like you&#39;d just love to
			cooperate...

	CATES Quietly sips his beer. The other occupants of the bar
	watch Hammond herd the four Punks to the end wall.

	A BIG COWBOY

	when Hammond isn&#39;t looking, he dashes toward the exit, Cates
	puts out a leg. Sends the Cowboy crashing into a crowdedtable.

	HAMMOND

	Turns around at the noise.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			That wasn&#39;t necessary, buddy. I
			got this under control.

					CATES
			Some of us citizens are with you
			all the way, Officer.

	The Redneck Punks are now spread-eagled against the wall.
	Hammond searches the first. He drops a wallet on the floor
	and moves to the second. A switchblade, some credit cards and
	another wallet fall to the floor. The last Punk has only a
	roll of bills.  Hammond holds the money up to his face.

					HAMMOND
			You&#39;re in trouble, big trouble, so
			you better start talking. Where&#39;d
			a boy like you make a score like
			this?

					PUNK
			It&#39;s mine, what the hell...

					HAMMOND
			You must a rolled somebody.  They
			don&#39;t let punks like you take jobs
			that pay this much ... you sure
			you don&#39;t know a dangerous Indian,
			because unless you start talkin&#39;
			I may just have to start looking
			down your pants with a
			flashlight...

					PUNK
			What kind of cop are you, anyway?

					HAMMOND
			I am your most terrible nightmare
			... a bad nigger with a badge that
			entitles him to kick your ass...

	Hammond turns to the Bartender...

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			One of them is under-age.  Another
			attacked a police officer. And you
			know I ain&#39;t found what I came
			lookin&#39; here for yet...

	Walks back to the Bartender.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			The tall one had a weapon ... you
			want me to keep on makin&#39; a list,
			or you got the picture yet?

	He reaches for a towel under a pyramid of bar glasses. Jerks
	the towel, the pyramid capsizes onto the floor. Huge crash as
	the glasses break into a million fragments.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			Looks like you&#39;re on your way to
			bein&#39; outta business, redneck...
			Now, let&#39;s see what can we fuck
			with next?

	The Bartender doesn&#39;t have the look of a happy man.

					BARTENDER
			Okay, okay.  The Indian hangs out
			with a girl down the block. Right
			where Chinatown starts.  She lives
			on top of the hardware store.

	Hammond turns, grins at Cates. As far as he&#39;s concerned, he&#39;s
	won the bet.  Cates nods, slips out the door.

					HAMMOND
			I don&#39;t give a damn about his
			girl...

					BARTENDER
			Look, give me a break, you&#39;re
			going to have to settle for her
			place.  It&#39;s the only thing I know.

	He looks desperate.

					BARTENDER
					 (continuing)
			I&#39;m tellin&#39; ya, I&#39;m giving you all
			I know.

					HAMMOND
			Try obeyin&#39; the law once in
			awhile, and I won&#39;t have to hassle
			you...

	Turns to go, then turns back.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			But remember this, cowboy, there&#39;s
			a new sheriff in town.

	Smiles, turns and goes.

	TRANSITION.

	STREET - ACROSS FROM TORCHIE&#39;S - NIGHT

	Hammond steps out of the bar.  He crosses to Cates by the car.

					CATES
			I think you got something for me.

	Pause.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			The gun you took off that redneck
			in there.

	Hammond smiles.

					HAMMOND
			You made that move, huh?

					CATES
			While you&#39;re at it, You can give
			me the switchblade, too.

	Hammond reluctantly takes out a .22 automatic, slams it down
	on the hood of the car.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			Credit cards?

	Hammond hands them over with the knife.

					HAMMOND
			You already got a gun and you owe
			me a piece of ass.  I&#39;ll settle
			for the gun you just took.

	A long moment. Then Cates slowly lifts the .22 automatic.

					CATES
			You did a real good job... Guess
			you deserve a reward.

	Removes the clip.  Throws it across the street. Hands Hammond
	the automatic.

					HAMMOND
			Motherfucker.

	He throws the gun away.

					CATES
			I sure am. Now let&#39;s go get us an
			Indian.

	They walk up the block.

	TRANSITION.

	STREET - CHINATOWN - NIGHT

	Neon signs with Sino lettering.

	CATES AND HAMMOND

	Walk down the street, spot a shop with a window display of
	tools.  Look up at the darkened apartment windows. They walk
	to the end of the block.

	ALLEY

	Stairwells lead to each apartment above the shops. Cates and
	Hammond move along the buildings... Arrive at the back of the
	hardware store. Quietly, they start to ascend the stairs.

	STAIRWELL

	The metal steps extend onto a platform by the back door.
	Cates leans over the railings to look through the adjacent
	window. Between the drawn curtains, a flickering glimmer from
	a TV set. On the tube, various poses from stridently
	exercising women.

					HAMMOND
			What the shit is that?

	Looks again. A female form passes by, goes out of the room.

					CATES
			There.

					HAMMOND
			Must be billy&#39;s girl.

					CATES
			Come on.

	DOORWAY

	Cates gestures to the door lock. Hammond fiddles with it for
	several moments. The door swings open. They step into a
	darkened room.

	APARTMENT

	Cates takes the .38 from his pocket. He stops near the open
	bedroom doorway. He looks at Hammond and then both men step
	quickly into the room.

					CATES
			Police! Nobody move!

	Hammond reaches for the light switch. Takes a heavy blow.
	Slumps against the door. A Woman&#39;s voice screams out.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			Stay where you are!

	The light goes on. Cates&#39; gun points at a YOUNG WOMAN (CASEY)
	in a flimsy dressing gown. Saturday Night Special held
	between her palms, police style... A SECOND WOMAN (SALLY)
	stands beside Hammond at the light switch. Larger and
	slightly older than the first, she wears a man&#39;s shirt. Holds
	a baseball bat in her right hand.

					SALLY
			You better drop it or he&#39;s gonna
			get another one.

					HAMMOND
			Hey, talk to here jack.  I don&#39;t
			feel like gettin&#39; number two along
			side of the head.

					CATES
			I said police.  Now drop the
			goddamn gun.

					CASEY
			Don&#39;t give me that police shit.
			You drop it.

	Pause.

					CATES
			Okay, look, don&#39;t shoot.  I&#39;m just
			reachin&#39; for my badge.

	Cates takes out his badge-Shows it to Casey.

					CASEY
			I don&#39;t like this bullshit. I&#39;ve
			seen fake badges before.

					HAMMOND
			I&#39;ll tell you something lady, this
			guy is a real nervous cop - He&#39;s
			just liable to pull the trigger.

	Cates takes two steps toward Casey...

					CATES
			Naw, I&#39;m the calm type.  I know
			you don&#39;t want me to shoot you,
			and I know that you don&#39;t want to
			shoot me.

	He takes two more steps toward her.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			Shooting a cop puts you away for
			a long time.

	Holds out his hand.

					CASEY
			You assholes better be real.

	She hands Cates the gun. Sally prods Hammond with the
	baseball bat.

					SALLY
			Just wait a Goddamn second here,
			let&#39;s see your badge...

	He snatches the bat out of her hands.

					HAMMOND
			Don&#39;t have one.

					SALLY
			I knew it.  Call the cops.

	Casey walks over to the phone.

					CATES
			Tell them it&#39;s Cates, Detective
			31st District.  Then put your
			clothes on. If you don&#39;t answer
			some questions I&#39;m taking both
			your asses in.

	After a moment, Casey puts down the phone.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			Now, let&#39;s cut out the crap, which
			one of you sees Billy Bear?

					SALLY
			None of your business, cop.  The
			son of a bitch isn&#39;t here, and he
			isn&#39;t coming back.

					CATES
			You can do better than that.

	Turns to Casey.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			How about it?

					CASEY
			I used to go with him...I don&#39;t
			know where the hell he is.  I
			haven&#39;t seen him for two weeks.
			And I don&#39;t think I will.  He owes
			me money...

					SALLY
			He&#39;s a Goddamn lowlife, the way he
			treated her.

					CATES
			Sounds like a real stormy romance.

					CASEY
			I don&#39;t much care what it sounds
			like to you, Cop. All I know is
			that I went a few laps around the
			track with him and I ended up with
			nothin&#39; but the short end of the
			stick.

	Cates looks over at Hammond.

					CATES
			Let&#39;s go.

					HAMMOND
			Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies
			would like to go a few laps with
			us.  How about it? I been nearly
			three years in prison and...

					SALLY
			Fuck off.

					CATES
			Come on...

	Hannond starts for the door with Cates.

					CASEY
			If you find that bastard, Billy,
			tell him to stay out of my life.
			I don&#39;t need any more of his macho
			bullshit.

	TRANSITION.

	STREET  CHINATOWN - NIGHT

	The two men walk among the bright neon lights. Neither of
	them very happy.

					CATES
			This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of
			my gun and goes all over the
			streets killing people with it.
			So, instead of me being where I
			oughta be, which is in bed giving
			my girl the high, hard one, I&#39;m
			out here doing this shit, roaming
			around with some overdressed,
			charcoal-colored loser like you.

					HAMMOND
			You wanna leave, man?  Let me take
			care of Ganz all by myself.

					CATES
			You?  Don&#39;t make me laugh.  You
			can&#39;t take care of shit.  You&#39;ve
			been dicking me around since we
			started on this turd-hunt.  All
			you&#39;re good for is games... So
			far, what I got outta you is
			nothin&#39;...

					HAMMOND
			I&#39;m impressed with you too, Jack
			you did a real good job of busting
			up a couple of dykes bedded down
			for the night.

					CATES
			Luther knew more than he told me
			and so do you...Now you better
			tell we what the fuck this is all
			about.  I gave you 48 hours to
			come up with something and the
			clock&#39;s runnin&#39; ...

	A long look at Hammond.

					HAMMOND
			Maybe I don&#39;t like the way you ask.

					CATES
			Who gives a Goddamn what you
			think? You&#39;re just a crook that&#39;s
			got a weekendpass ... You&#39;re not
			even a name anymore. Just a spear-
			chucker with a Goddamn number
			stenciled on the back of his
			prison fatigues...

	They walk past.

	TRANSITION.

	STREET ACROSS FROM TORCHIE&#39;S - NIGHT

	They two men walk toward the Cadillac.

					CATES
			Okay, Reggie, I&#39;m done playing
			around. I want to know what&#39;s
			going on and I&#39;m going to beat the
			living shit out of you until you
			tell me.

	Hammond goes into a street rap.

					HAMMOND
			You beat the shit out of me?
			Don&#39;t make me laugh, sucker.  You
			don&#39;t know how I&#39;d dance on your
			face?  I&#39;ll hit you so hard, so
			many times, you&#39;ll wish you&#39;d
			never been hatched.  I&#39;ll turn
			your face into cottage cheese.
			I&#39;ll make your girl think you been
			takin&#39; ugly pills.  She won&#39;t even
			know who you are, sucker.

	They stop by the car. Cates takes the gun out, lays it on the
	hood.  Hammond stares at him. Cates next takes out his
	wallet, shows Hammond his badge, then lays the badge on the
	car fender... Smiles.

					CATES
			I guess the first thing I ought,
			to explain to you, nigger, is I
			fight dirty.

	Hits Hammond a tremendous right hand full in the face.
	Hammond sags, grabs onto the car fender for support. Cates
	hesitates ... and Hammond kicks out, sending the partially
	open car door slamming into Cates. Cates sprawls.

					HAMMOND
			So do I.

	Hammond aims a kick at Cates&#39; head.  Cates blocks it with
	crossed forearms, grabs, twists.  Hammond tumbles, rolls away
	from Cates.  Both men struggle to their feet, circle each
	other.

	Hammond moves in only to receive twoquick blows from Cates,
	a bit sooner than he expected.  Cates smiles.

	Hammond dances in and out... Cates&#39; breathing becomes more
	labored. His windmill attack penetrates Cates&#39; defense. Cates
	clears his head, charges, bull-like ... His rush and greater
	bulk send both of them crashing into some trash cans and a
	brick wall.

	Hammond is faster...

	Cates is much stronger; Both men on their knees. They look at
	one another. Silently, they move to their feet. Hammond&#39;s
	back is to a wall... Cates keeps him there, negates the
	lighter man&#39;s agility. They slug away, each now arm-weary...
	Exchange a dozen blows. Finally, Cates steps back, arms at
	his side... Breath coming like a bellows...

	Hammond has to hold on to the wall; one more punch would put
	him out.

					CATES
			Now, you bastard, you going to
			tell me what&#39;s going on...

	Puffing away.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			... Do I have to kick the shit out
			of you some more.

	They stand facing one another. Hammond smiles. A black-and-
	white comes roaring up the street. Sirens howling, red lights
	flashing, it slides to a stop. TWO UNIFORMED COPS jump out,
	guns drawn.

					FIRST COP
			All right, you two.  Don&#39;t move.

					CATES
			NO, no...it&#39;s okay...I&#39;m police.

					SECOND COP
			Yeah, sure.  Get your hands above
			your head.

	He keeps his gun trained on Cates,and Hammond.

					CATES
			My gun and badge are over there.
			And I&#39;m too fucking tired to raise
			my hands...

	Hammond rubs the side of his face. Cates falls back against
	the patrol car. Still fighting for breath. The First Cop
	lifts Cates&#39; wallet off the Cadillac and looks at his badge,
	shows it to the other cop.

					FIRST COP
			What the hell&#39;s going on here?

	Cates walks over, pockets his gun.

					SECOND COP
			I&#39;ve got a burglary call.  Two
			women say a couple of hoods broke
			into their place posing as cops.

					CATES
			I was following a lead.  We
			rousted them... Go up and sweet
			talk &#39;em.  You can straighten it
			out.

	The First Cop checks out Cates&#39; badge and I.D.

					FIRST COP
			Why don&#39;t you do it?  We got
			better things to do than
			straighten out your messes.

					CATES
			So do I. I&#39;ll file a report
			tomorrow.

	The First Cop takes out his book, starts writing.  He&#39;s
	pissed.

					FIRST COP
			I gotta file a..Report tonight
			asshole...

					CATES
			Goes with the territory.

	He grabs Hammond and they head for the Cadillac.

	TRANSITION.

	ALL-NIGHT GAS STATION

	Cadillac parked behind the service area.

	RESTROOM

	Hammond looks&#39; up at his bruised face in the mirror, then
	washes up.  Cates is one step ahead of him. He rolls up a
	piece of the wet towel and inserts it over his bleeding gum.

					HAMMOND
			Too bad we got interrupted when we
			did.  I was getting ready to
			finish you off.

	Cates straightens up from the wash basin.

					CATES
			Yeah, right.  You want to try
			again?

					HAMMOND
			Naw, you&#39;d just call your pals
			back to bail you out one more time.

					CATES
			They saved your ass, convict.

					HAMMOND
			One thing&#39;s for sure, Jack.
			That&#39;s how you&#39;ll tell the story.

	Cates dries off his face, starts out of the washroom.

					CATES
			I&#39;ll even put it in my report that
			way.

	The door closes behind Cates. Hammond leans back toward the
	mirror, nudges a tooth with his finger.

					HAMMOND
			Motherfucker.

	GAS STATION PARKING LOT

	Cates leans on the Cadillac as Hammond emerges. Hammond
	starts for the passenger side.

					CATES
			Wait a minute.

	Hammond stops.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			You come clean or we&#39;re going to
			go again.  Right here, right now.

	Pause.

	A long moment; Hammond decides be has no choice.

					HAMMOND
			I been waiting a long time for
			some money.

					CATES
			How much?

					HAMMOND
			Half a million.

					CATES
			Jesus.

	Hammond smiles his meanest smile.

					HAMMOND
			How&#39;s that for a number to give
			you heart failure? Guess you might
			start to get the picture after
			all. Mlaybe you&#39;re on the wrong
			side of the old law and order
			business..

	Cates is unmoved.

					CATES
			Just tell me about the money.

					HAMMOND
			Me and my bunch hit a dealer in
			the middle of a sale. It&#39;s the
			kind of money nobody ever reports
			stolen. I was sittin&#39; pretty,
			livin&#39; in the high cotton, then
			somebody fingered me for another
			job. ... Some psycho who&#39;s out
			there capping people with some
			cop&#39;s gun.

					CATES
			He&#39;s after your money.

					HAMMOND
			You catch on real fast...Okay,
			Jack, let&#39;s talk deal. How much of
			my money you gonna let me keep?

	Cates just looks at him.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			We split 50-50?

					CATES
			Not likely, convict.

					HAMMOND
			You gonna let me keep any of it?

					CATES
			Depends on how things work out. I
			believe in the merit system. So
			far you haven&#39;t built up any
			points.

	He smiles.

					HAMMOND
			Okay, from now on, I&#39;m gonna be
			real good, Jack.

	Cates smiles back.

					CATES
			Where&#39;s the money?

					HAMMOND
			In the trunk of a car.  A lot
			better than under a mattress,
			right?

	Cates smiles.

					CATES
			Right, partner.

					HAMMOND
			Get this. We ain&#39;t partners. We
			ain&#39;t brothers. We ain&#39;t friends.
			If Ganz gets away with my money,
			you&#39;re gonna be sorry we ever met.

					CATES
			Yeah.  Right.

	They get into the Caddy. Boom away.

	TRANSITION.

	The Cadillac moving through the city... Clock on the
	dashboard showing 4 a.m. Cates at the wheel.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			Where&#39;s the goddamn car?

					HAMMOND
			You&#39;re a real case, you know that,
			Jack?

	Smiles.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			This&#39;ll show you how smart I am.
			I got it parked.

					CATES
			...For three years?  Let&#39;s hope it
			wasn&#39;t a tow-away zone.

					HAMMOND
			You just drove by it.

	The Cadillac makes a screeching U-turn,i swings into the curb.

	Cates leans out, looks at...

	PARKING BUILDING

	Narrow, multi-storied, with a garage-like opening and
	signals... proclaiming &#39;Weekly-Monthly-Long Term.&quot;

	CADILLAC

					CATES
			Okay, now what?

	Hammond gets out of the car.

	Stands on the sidewalk.

	Stretches.

	Then gets into the back seats.

					HAMMOND
			Since you&#39;re wired on benniest you
			get to stay up and stare at the
			building. I&#39;m  tired, so I&#39;m going
			to sleep. They take Sunday off.
			Place opens at seven o&#39;clock
			Monday morning. Wake me up at a
			quarter till...

	Cates stares at the place.

					CATES
			You son of a bitch. You knew where
			the money was all along and all we
			had to do was come here and wait.
			I almost got my ass blown off
			twice tonight for nothing.

					HAMMOND
			I wasn&#39;t sure the money was still
			there until we saw Luther. You
			almost got your ass shot off for
			nothing once, not twice, Jack.

					CATES
			Shit.

	THE CITY

	Beyond the skyline, grey streaks of dawn etch the sky.

	TRANSITION.

	The Cadillac is pulled up facing the streets down the block
	from the parking sections Cates walks in through the lot
	entrance. Threads his way between the lines of parked
	vehicles Tired and haggard, he carries a paper bag filled
	with quick-order food.

	CADILLAC

	Hammond stretches on the back seat.  Cates slams the door
	shut.

					CATES
			I don&#39;t want you sleeping on the
			job.

	Hammond yawns, eases himself into a sitting position.

					HAMMOND
			The place opens in five minutes.
			Ganz ought to be here soon...

	Cates tears the paper bag open. Passes a cup of coffee and
	donut back. He sips his own coffee, adds some whiskey from
	his flask... pops another bennie.

					CATES
			You took a big chance, leaving
			this here all this time.

					HAMMOND
			Not really.  I figured Ganz was
			put down for a long time.  And I
			knew Luther would never job me on
			his own.  He&#39;s too chickenshit.

					CATES
			Guess what?  Luther just got in
			line.

	Hammond sits up.

					HAMMOND
			What?

					CATES
			Musta got some primo bondsman.

					HAMMOND
			Jesus Christ.  That&#39;s a disgrace
			The guy pulls a gun on a cop and
			he&#39;s out in 24 hours.  I tell you
			some of the courts these days are
			just a fucking revolving door.

	INT. PARKING LOT BUILDING

	Luther walks up to the window where a bored ATTENDANT reads
	a comic book.

					ATTENDANT
			Yeah?

					LUTHER
			I want to pick up my car.

	He passes across a faded form.

					ATTENDANT
			Name?

					LUTHER
			Hammond.

	The Attendant examines the form, surprised.

					ATTENDANT
			This is three years old.

					LUTHER
			Yeah, I&#39;ve been busy.

	The Attendant opens a key file, begins rummaging in it.

					ATTENDANT
			We don&#39;t wash &#39;em, ya know.

					LUTHER
			How about chargin&#39; the battery?

					ATTENDANT
			That we do. And we put air in the
			tires. I&#39;ll even sell you some gas
			if you need it.

					LUTHER
			Great, just great.

	The Attendant finds the key, exits the booth. Luther follows
	to an elevated stack of cars. The Attendant throws a switch,
	the stack of cars begins to move.

	STREET

	Luther drives down the exit ramp in a dated Porsche
	convertible.

	The car is covered with a uniform coat of dust, except for
	the windshield which has been wiped hastily clean.

	Luther waits for a break in the flow of traffic, drives out.

	Another street

	Luther turns onto a side street and then suddenly Cate&#39;s
	Cadillac appears ... starts to tail the Porsche.

	CADILLAC

	Cates follows Luther through several turns.

	The Porsche jerks whenever it speeds up or slows down.

					HAMMOND
			Jesus Christ, look at all the dust
			on my car...why in the hell don&#39;t
			he take it to a car wash?

					CATES
			Didn&#39;t know you darker people went
			in for foreign jobs.

					HAMMOND
			I had no choice. Some white
			asshole bought the last piece of
			shit skyblue Cadillac.

	ANOTHER STREET

	The Caddy follows the Porsche.

	INT. CADDY

	As they follow Luther.

					CATES
			You&#39;d think the guy&#39;d be smart
			enough to know he was being tailed.

					HAMMOND
			Tryin&#39; to save his girl, man. He&#39;s
			in another world.

					CATES
			If I was his size and had Ganz on
			my ass, I&#39;d  just leave town.

					HAMMOND
			I&#39;m tellin&#39; you the man&#39;s in
			love... he wants to be a hero for
			his girl.

					CATES
			Oh, yeah, does bein&#39; in love make
			you stupid?

	ANOTHER STREET

	The Caddy follows the Porsche.

	As they follow Luther.

					CATES
			I suppose you&#39;d never be like
			Luther and let a woman get to
			you...

					HAMMOND
			I let women get to me.  The quest
			for pussy is the meaning of life
			... I got my own personal
			philosophy about &#39;em.  Keep women
			separate from guns, money and
			business ... women are for
			spending money.  They got nothing
			to do with helping you make it.

					CATES
			That ain&#39;t philosophy.  That&#39;s
			common sense.

	ANOTHER STREET

	The Caddy follows the Porsche.

	INT. CADDY

	As they follow Luther.

					HAMMOND
			Say, do you always work people
			over like you did Luther?

					CATES
			If they don&#39;t tell me what I need
			to know...

					HAMMOND
			Doesn&#39;t it get... Tiring?

					CATES
			I&#39;m not in this &#39;cause it&#39;s fun.
			I&#39;m not into hitting guys &#39;cause
			it makes me feel good either... I
			do it &#39;cause it works-...

					HAMMOND
			You got a very depressing view of
			life, man... you gotta smile once
			in awhile...

	ANOTHER STREET

	The Caddy follows the Porsche.

	INT. CADDY

	As they follow Luther.

					CATES
			Maybe Luther hopes Ganz&#39;ll give
			him a piece of your money...

					HAMMOND
			If he&#39;s hoping that then he&#39;s
			dumber than I think he is, which
			would be amazin&#39;, cause I already
			think he&#39;s real dumb.

	ANOTHER STREET

	The Caddy follows the Porsche.

	INT. CADDY

	As they follow Luther.

					HAMMOND
			A long time agb Luther must of got
			the shit beat out of him so bad it
			just rattled his brain ... that
			would account for him making so
			many wrong moves in a row...

					CATES
			Yeah, it doesn&#39;t look like he&#39;s
			gonna make it as a dangerous tough
			guy...

	ANOTHER STREET

	The Caddy follows the Porsche.

	INT. CADDY

	As they follow Luther,

					HAMMOND
			You know, I&#39;d be embarrassed if I
			let my wheels go the way you&#39;ve
			done with this job.

					CATES
			What you don&#39;t understand is, I
			don&#39;t give a damn about how this
			thing looks.

					HAMMOND
			No class...

					CATES
			Class isn&#39;t somethin&#39; you buy,
			punk. Look at you, five hundred
			dollar suit and you&#39;re still a
			lowlife.

	ANOTHER STREET

	The Caddy follows the Porsche.

	INT.  CADDY

	As they follow Luther.

					HAMMOND
			We&#39;re getting too close ... Cates,
			what&#39;s the matter, you been takin&#39;
			dumb pills?

					CATES
			Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb...
			But since you&#39;re the one that
			landed in jail what&#39;s that make
			you?

	ANOTHER STREET

	Luther pulls over to curb and parks.

	CADILLAC

	suddenly swings over several lanes of traffic and parks in
	driveway of parking lot.

	LUTHER - CATES &amp; HAMMOND&#39;S P.O.V.

	He goes to the trunk. Rummages there ... picks up a flaming
	red suit.

	INT. CADILLAC

					CATES
			That Goddamn suit is yours?

	Hammond winces.

					HAMMOND
			That was in style a couple years
			back, man.

					CATES
			Right. if you ever switch from
			armed robbery to pimping, then
			you&#39;re all set.

	Under the suit is a nondescript attache case. Luther takes
	it, closes the trunk. Beads down the sidewalk.

	CADILLAC

					HAMMOND
			That&#39;s the money, Jack.

	They jump out of the car, follow on foot.

	STREET

	Luther hurries along the sidewalk.

	He reaches the corner, turns quickly...

	CATES AND HAMMOND

	Following a little way behind.

	They pause at the corner, watching the pedestrian traffic
	move by. Then turn down the cross street after Luther. Follow
	him down a stairwell.

	SUBWAY STATION - LOBBY

	Escalators and open stairwells. Luther enters and pauses by
	the doorway. Commuters crowd the counters and congregate near
	the stairwells. More people are seated along hard plastic
	seats. But no Ganz.  And no Billy.

	Luther moves further into the station.  Cates and Hammond
	enter. They keep Luther fixed between them, 50 feet ahead.
	Luther seems to be wandering He walks through the shop area
	and back toward the escalator. Hammond remains near the
	arcade while Cates blends in with the commuters. Luther puts
	the briefcase down at his feet and leans against a counter.
	Next to him, a loud troop of Boy Scouts marches by.  A crowd
	of people from the train area below flows through the lobby
	obscuring Luther from Hammond and Cates for a moment.  Cates
	steps out to get a better view and suddenly spots Ganz moving
	through the crowd toward Luther. Be looks over at Hammond
	across the station and motions.  Then they both start moving
	in on Ganz, trying to intercept him before he gets deeper
	into the crowd.

	Ganz moves cautiously through the station. A crumpled
	newspaper held absently in his hand. He scans the faces of
	the commuters and spots Luther. Fails to notice Cates and
	Hammond closing in on him from two directions.

	A PATROLMAN comes up. Starts chatting amiably with a Boy
	Scout next to Luther. Ganz hesitates in his approach. He
	motions Luther to move awaye, but Luther starts to panic when
	he sees Cates and Hammond closing in...

	Ganz reacts to Luther, turns and spots the two men. He makes
	an immediate break for open ground. The Patrolman sees Ganz
	start to run. The newspaper is thrown to the floor... Ganz
	swings Cates&#39; .44 toward Hammond.

					PATROLMAN
			Hey--you!

	Ganz whirls, his feet slipping on the marble floor. His shot
	at Hammond goes plowing into the ceiling. The crowd starts to
	panic and run in all directions.

	The Patrolman has al ready brought his own gun out. Levels it
	at Ganz.

					PATROLMAN
					 (continuing)
			Put it down.

	BILLY BEAR

	Suddenly appears, Rosalie at his side. Billy Bear&#39;s .44
	blasts the Patrolman onto his back.

	Ganz comes up and scrambles through the screaming patrons.
	He, Billy and Rosalie head toward the escalator. Cates has
	already brought out his .38... Can&#39;t get a clean shot through
	the chaos.

	Hammond pushes his way through the crowd to Cates.

					HAMMOND
			Shoot the sons of bitches.

	Cates can&#39;t risk it...

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			You don&#39;t want to chance it, then
			give me the gun...

	A moment.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			Bullshit. Then i&#39;m staying with
			the money.

					CATES
			You stay with me...

					HAMMOND
			No way...

	Hammond starts after Luther. Cates turns, starts to aim at
	Hammond. Hesitates...

	PASSENGER WALKWAY

	Panic has overtaken everyone as they try to escape the madman
	with the gun.

	Ganz and Billy elbow and kick their way through the crowd,
	tugging Rosalie along...

	Cates, gun in hand, creates further-panic as he moves after
	Ganz.

	Ganz grabs a man beside him.

	Shoves him hard into the passengers in back.

	The man knocks over several more people creating a roadblock.

	Ganz vaults over the railing and starts for the trains.
	Cates loses a few more precious seconds grappling through the
	terrorized passengers...

	TRAIN AREA

	The usually jammed area looks like an empty stockyard. The
	patrons huddle in fear against any available wall.

	Cates bursts out of the stairwell...

	TUNNEL

	Red and green signal lights. The light goes red, a train
	roars up and the doors hiss open.

	Billy and Ganz fight through the passengers getting off the
	train, jump on board; Billy pulls Rosalie behind him.

	CATES

	Running for the doors...

	Suddenly, a SECURITY OFFICER appears, riot gun in hand.

					SECURITY OFFICER
			Freeze!

					CATES
			No! No!  There they are!

					SECURITY OFFICER
			Just put it down real slow.

	The train doors close.

					CATES
			I&#39;m a policeman, you asshole!

					SECURITY OFFICER
			Don&#39;t even try... now drop it
			or - you&#39;re all done.

	He means it, points the riot gun even closer... The train in
	front of him moves away.

	Cates carefully places the .38 on the pavement. Then raises
	his hands in the air.

					CATES
			Shit.

	TRAIN STATION - LOBBY

	Witnesses stand in nervous little knots. Give versions of
	what happened to notepad-toting patrolmen. Hospital
	Attendants minister to various and sundry complaints.

	Cates sits on a passenger bench, obviously dejected.  A
	voice comes echoing from behind.

					HADEN
			Cates.

	Haden, silhouetted against the light from the street.

					HADEN
					 (continuing)
			What the bell happened?

					CATES
			I lost them, that&#39;s what happened.

					HADEN
			How did they get away?

					CATES
			They ran.  As fast as they could.
			Caught a train.

	Haden watches the Morgue Personnel wheel out the body of the
	Patrolman.

					HADEN
			Which one pulled the trigger?

					CATES
			The Indian.  I was about 30 yards
			away.

					HADEN
			You couldn&#39;t get to him?

	Cates shrugs.

					HADEN
					 (continuing)
			What a screw-up.

					CATES
			Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked
			up. I messed up.  Anybody could
			have done better, especially you.
			I bet you&#39;re real good at hitting
			targets through crowds.

	Haden starts toward the street. Looks back at Cates.

					HADEN
			Don&#39;t duck the bullet Cates. Why
			didn&#39;t you call in for backup
			instead of makin&#39; a grandstand
			play?

					CATES
			I didn&#39;t have the time.

					HADEN
			Too bad, it would&#39;ve covered your
			ass.  Now you&#39;re in the shit and
			so&#39;s the department. In case you
			haven&#39;t noticed, this wasn&#39;t our
			finest hour... I told you everyone
			was watchin&#39; on this one. Maybe
			you better start thinkin&#39; about
			writin&#39; tickets off a three wheel
			bike.

	Cates looks at Haden for a moment...

	Turns and walks away.

	TRANSITION.

	PREDMORE HOTEL - NIGHT

	Hammond across the street from Predmore.

	Standing in a phone booth talking into the receiver...

	He turns and looks acain at the hotel...

	Hangs up.

	Walks into a nearby bar.

	TRANSITION.

	VROMAN&#39;S ROCK CLUB

	HAMMOND

	Punk Dancers all over the floor.

	A rock group blasting away...(&quot;NEW SHOES&quot; - Vocal)

	HAMMOND

	At a back booth...

	A MAN (SOSNA) approaches carrying a small suitcase.

					HAMMOND
			How you doing, man?

					SOSNA
			Not bad, not bad.

	Puts the suitcase down on the table.

					SOSNA
					 (continuing)
			You want to go outside?

					HAMMOND
			Naw, right here&#39;s okay.

	Dancers sliding and jerking in front of them.

					SOSNA
			You sure?

					HAMMOND
			I&#39;m sure.  Everybody here&#39;s
			looking at everybody else&#39;s ass.

	Sosna pops open the suitcase. Lid shielding the contents from
	the patrons...

					SOSNA
			I got some real nice merchandise.
			All of it&#39;s clean.

	Suitcase arranged like q salesman&#39;s display case. Tightly
	spaced rows of handguns mounted in their holsters.

					HAMMOND
			I like this one...

	Pockets a revolver with a deft move.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			How about some ammo?

					SOSNA
			It&#39;s loaded... I got some shells
			in here.

	Opens another compartment. Hammond helps himself to two
	boxes...

					HAMMOND
			How much?

					SOSNA
			This is clean shit.  No serial
			numbers and never been used...

					HAMMOND
			Don&#39;t mess with me. How much?

					SOSNA
			Five bills.

					HAMMOND
			Five.  On credit.

					SOSNA
			This ain&#39;t a credit business.

	You know that.

					HAMMOND
			Yeah, I know that, but this is me
			and we&#39;re old friends. I haven&#39;t
			got the money so what are you
			gonna do about it?

					SOSNA
			Give it back.

					HAMMOND
			Try and take it.

	A long moment.

					SOSNA
			Fuck you.  You got no right for
			this kind of play.

					HAMMOND
			I&#39;ll got your money to you. No
			sweat.

	Hammonds heads for the bar.

	Stands next to a good-looking woman (RITA). Nods to the
	barkeep.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			Vodka. With a twist. And I want to
			run a tab.

	Served up. He knocks half of it back, turns to the woman.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			My name&#39;s Reggie Hammond.

	Big personality smile.

					RITA
			So what?

	She turns away as he takes a drink. He looks at another
	pretty girl (ANGELA).

					HAMMOND
			Hi there. I&#39;m Reggie Hammond.

					ANGELA
			I&#39;m with somebody.

	She turns away.

					HAMMOND
			This ain&#39;t my night.

	He drinks up.

	TRANSITION.

	SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

	Several Detectives are working at desks. Kehoe walks into the
	office. He moves slowly to Cates&#39; desk and slumps down in a
	nearby chair.

					KEHOE
			You look awful.

					CATES
			So do you...been a long day.

					KEHOE
			Long night, too, from what I heard
			... Word&#39;s going around that in
			addition to losing Ganz for the
			second time, and in addition to
			Haden busting you back to
			Patrolman, some jig beat the crap
			out of you.

					CATES
			Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.

					KEHOE
			Doesn&#39;t look like it.

					CATES
			Nothing came in for me yet?  No
			calls?

					KEHOE
			Nothing.

	Kehoe&#39;s phone begins to ring.  Cates watches hopefully.

					KEHOE
					 (continuing)
			Kehoe... Okay, hang on.

	Offers the phone to Cates.

					KEHOE
					 (continuing)
			It&#39;s for you... Ordinance.

	Cates&#39; excitement vanishes. He takes the receiver. Kehoe
	begins to clean off his desk.

					CATES
			Hello... Yeah, okay.  I&#39;ll be in
			tomorrow. That&#39;s right, you can
			depend on it.  Okay?

	He slams down the receiver, leans back in the chair.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			Bullshit red tape.

					KEHOE
			I&#39;m heading out. How about you?

	Cates shakes his head.

					CATES
			I got to wait for a call.

					KEHOE
			Okay.  See you in the morning...
			you know, you ought to get some
			rest...

	He walks out the door. Cates stares fixedly at the phone on
	the desk. Hoping Hammond will call... Across the room another
	phone starts to ring. Cates stares at the PLAINCLOTHESMAN who
	answers.

					PLAINCLOTHESMAN
			Yeah, he&#39;s here.

	Cates stiffens.

					PLAINCLOTHESMAN
					 (continuing)
			Cates... line twelve.

	Cates snatches up the phone, shouts into it...

					CATES
			You motherfucker, where are you?

	ELAINE

	In the Chronicle Restaurant and Bar, a well appointed
	establishment off Montgomery Street.

					ELAINE
			I&#39;m at work, asshole.  Where else?

					CATES
			Elaine! I... I&#39;m sorry... I was
			expecting somebody else... police
			business.

					ELAINE
			No wonder you&#39;re so popular.

					CATES
			No, it&#39;s I&#39;m just surprised you
			called.

					ELAINE
			So am I.

				  ELAINE				CATES
		Jack, this afternoon...	  Hey, look, when...

					ELAINE
			You first.

					CATES
			Look, I&#39;m sorry about ... the way
			things have been lately.  I know
			I haven&#39;t been acting real great...

	Behind Cates, Kehoe steps back into the room.

					KEHOE
			Hey, Cates...

	Cates swings around.

					KEHOE
					 (continuing)
			I almost forgot.  That pal of
			yours from the Vice Squad wants
			you to call him.

					CATES
			What?

					ELAINE
			Jack, are you still there?

					KEHOE
			Yeah.  He said he rousted a bar
			with you last night.

					CATES
			Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn&#39;t
			you tell me before?

					KEHOE
			I&#39;m not paid to take your personal
			calls.  He was in some bar. .. off
			duty.

	Cates interrupts.

					CATES
			The number ... what&#39;s the Goddamn
			number?

					ELAINE
			Jack?  What was that?

					KEHOE
			Find it yourself.  It&#39;s on my desk.

	Cates speaks back into the receiver.

					CATES
			Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...

					ELAINE
			Jack, wait...

					CATES
			Just a second, that&#39;s all!

	He hits the bold button, starts rummaging through the desk.
	Paperwork scatters in all directions.

	Kehoe watches him in silence for awhile then leaves. Cates
	begins to dial.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			Hammond... you son of a bitch,
			where are you?

	Listens for a moment.

	VROMAN&#39;S ROCK CLUB

	Hammond on the phone as the band rocks away.   (MONKEY
	MASH - Track only)

					HAMMOND
			Hey, Jack, how ya doin&#39;? What took
			you so long to call, man? I been
			waitin&#39; ... I&#39;m at Vroman&#39;s up in
			the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman&#39;s...
			&#39;Course you don&#39;t hang out here;
			it&#39;s for the brothers.

	SQUAD ROOM

					CATES
			I&#39;ll be there in a minute. You
			don&#39;t move your ass, right?

	Slams down the phone. Starts toward the door. Remembers...

	He dashes back to the phone, hits the other line. Hears only
	a buzz.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			Oh, shit.

	TRANSITION.

	VROMAN&#39;S ROCK CLUB

	Band blasting away on another number (THE BOYS ARE BACK IN
	TOWN - VOCAL)

	Hammond now in the middle of the floor dancing his ass off
	with a girl named CANDY. As the song ends...

					HAMMOND
			My name&#39;s Reggie Hammond.

	Tries his big personality smile.

	This time gets one back.

					CANDY
			I&#39;m candy...

					HAMMOND
			Excuse me, baby, but if i don&#39;t
			get some action tonight, I&#39;m gonna
			bust.  You interested?

					CANDY
			Hey, what kind of talk is that?

					HAMMOND
			Oh ... You&#39;re a schoolteacher...

					CANDY
			No, I go to a school to learn how
			to do hair. It&#39;s a government
			program. But really I want to be
			a model - and I am definitely not
			sellin&#39;.

					HAMMOND
					 (humorously)
			Goodbye.

	She stops him.

					CANDY
			Hey, don&#39;t you think a hair
			stylists got any interest in
			gettin&#39; it on?

					HAMMOND
			Here you go sweetheart, throw it
			my way.

	He gives her a kiss.

					CANDY
			You&#39;re in a hurry.

					HAMMOND
			Yeah, i been waiting three years.

					CANDY
			You just quit bein&#39; a priest or
			somethin&#39;?

					HAMMOND
			No, baby, nothin&#39; like that.
			Look, there&#39;s a place across the
			street. We can go right over
			there...

					CANDY
			What&#39;s the matter with my place?

					HAMMOND
			No, it&#39;s gotta be here and now.
			Believe me. Only I don&#39;t have the
			damn money for a room...

	The band starts up again. (&quot;LOVE SONGS ARE FOR CRAZIES&quot; -
	VOCAL)

					CANDY
			Yeah, well, even us non-pros
			expect the guy to pay for the
			room...

	Cates suddenly appears... steps between them. Yells above the
	band&#39;s noise.

					CATES
			Where&#39;s luther?

					HAMMOND
			Be polite. Say hello.  This is
			Candy.

					CATES
			Hello. And goodbye.

	She looks at Hammond. He nods.

					CANDY
			Well, maybe I&#39;ll see you later ...

					HAMMOND
			Here&#39;s hoping, baby...

	Candy leaves and melts into the crowd on the dance floor.

					CATES
			What about Luther?

					HAMMOND
			What about Ganz?

	Cates shrugs.

					CATES
			We missed.

					HAMMOND
			You missed ... Luther took a taxi
			to the hotel across the street.
			Made a phone call.

					CATES
			Maybe we should pay Luther a
			visit.

					HAMMOND
			Let him get some sleep.  He&#39;s
			going to need it.

	They move to the bar.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			They must have set up a meeting
			for the morning; Luther left an 8
			am wake-up and put up the &quot;Don&#39;t
			Disturb&quot; sign.  He&#39;s trading his
			girl for the money.  All we have
			to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.

					CATES
			So you took the rest of the night
			off...

	Hammond smiles.

					HAMMOND
			We don&#39;t have too many
			cheerleaders in prison. I though
			I might indulge myself in a little
			trim.

	Cates orders two drinks.

					CATES
			Tell me something.  Why didn&#39;t you
			just take the money off Luther and
			split?

					HAMMOND
			Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as
			you do and I got some other news
			for you...

	He opens his jacket slightly. Reveals a shoulder holster and
	accompanying .45.  A long moment.

					CATES
			I don&#39;t know why, but I&#39;m going to
			let you keep it. Maybe because you
			told me you had it, or maybe just
			because I&#39;m too tired to argue...

					HAMMOND
			You sure that&#39;s the reason?

	Pause.

					CATES
			Thanks for callin&#39; in... and I
			guess Maybe... Look, I&#39;m sorry I
			called you Watermellon nigger...
			those kinds of things. I was just
			leanin&#39; on ya, doin&#39; my job.

					HAMMOND
			Bein&#39; good at your job don&#39;t
			explain everything, Jack ...

					CATES
			Yeah. Guess not.

	Hammond gives him a big smile.

					HAMMOND
			As long as you&#39;re feeling like Abe
			Lincoln, how about payin&#39; me on
			our bet?  We got time and all this
			pussy around here&#39;s drivin&#39; me
			crazy. See that one over there,
			the one I was with...

	He nods at Candy across the way.

					CATES
			Yeah, I see her.

					HAMMOND
			I can just take her right across
			the street to Luther&#39;s hotel.  All
			I need is some money for the room.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)

	Big smile as Cates produces some cash. Hammond counts it
	eagerly. Looks around. Candy suddenly appears like a trout
	seeing a lure.  She grabs the money.

					CANDY
			Hello, again.

					HAMMOND
			I just struck it rich... I think
			we can do a little business.  As
			a matter of fact, I think we can
			have a party.

	Hammond smiles, leads her out of the bar.

					CATES
			Hurry back.

	Cates watches them go, downs his drink. He fishes in his
	pocket for a coin, moves to a wall phone. Dials...

	CHRONICLE RESTAURANT BAR - NIGHT

	A COCKTAIL WAITRESS answers the phone as Elaine pours a drink.

					COCKTAIL WAITRESS
			It&#39;s for you.

	Hands her the receiver.

					ELAINE
			Hello.

					CATES
			Hi, it&#39;s me...

					ELAINE
			Fuck you.

	She slams down the receiver.

	SIDEWALK - FRONT OF VROMAN&#39;S - NIGHT

	Hammond and Candy exit the rock club. A line of young Punkers
	waiting to get inside... Hammond and Candy are in a tight
	clinch, a little giggly.

					CANDY
			So... what did you have in mind?

	Suddenly, Hammond sees Luther emerge from the Predmore across
	the street.

					HAMMOND
			Oh no, not now!

	Luther moves down the street with the briefcase.  Hammond
	pulls Candy back inside Vroman&#39;s.

	VROMAN&#39;S ROCK CLUB - BAR

	Rock group still blasting away... (LOVE SONGS ARE FOR
	CRAZIES - Vocal continues)

	Hammond and Candy reappear, knocking aside a waitress about
	to refill Cates&#39; drink.

					CATES
			That was quick.

					HAMMOND
			When you been in prison three
			years, it don&#39;t take long. Let&#39;s
			go.

					CATES
			Why?

					HAMMOND
			Luther&#39;s on the move...

	Cates jumps up, runs out. Hammond looks at Candy.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			I&#39;ll be back. Trust me.

	He kisses her.

	Runs off after Cates. She stares at him in disbelief.

	STREET LIGHT

	Luther checking over his shoulder for shadows, walks down the
	block. Turns into a narrow street.

	A BUS STOP

	Luther waits, impatient.

	Checks his watch.

	Looks up and down the street.

	He double-checks the bus stop sign over his head.

	Just as a bus pulls to a stop, air brakes hissing ...

	LUTHER

	Gets in.

	Sees that the driver is Billy Bear...

	BUS

	The bus starts up. Luther hesitates in the front. On the wide
	rear seat is Ganz. Rosalie beside him.

					GANZ
			Open your coat. Both sides.

	He shows he&#39;s not packed.

					LUTHER
			Let her go.

					GANZ
			First, the money.

	Luther takes a step.

					GANZ
					 (continuing)
			Just show me.

	Luther puts the case on a side seat, opens it for display.

	ANOTHER BUS STOP

	Commuters look up expectantly. One of two drift toward the
	curb. Jump back in alarm as the bus roars by.

	BUS

	Ganz is satisfied. Luther closes the case.

					LUTHER
			Rosalie, you okay?

					GANZ
			What are you talkin&#39; about? I said
			I wouldn&#39;t hurt her.

	And then he shoots Luther. Right between the buttons.

					GANZ
					 (continuing)
			I never break my word.

	Laughs as Rosalie begins to scream.

	CATES&#39; CADDY

	Barreling down the street, ignoring red lights.

	Hammond shouts over the wind.

					HAMMOND
			Notice something funny about that
			bus?

					CATES
			Yeah. It missed the last four
			stops.

	Cates pours on the gas.

	BILLY BEAR

	His eyes fall on the rear view mirror. A white Caddy dances
	in the vibrating glass. Billy looks over his shoulder at Ganz.

					BILLY
			Ganz!

	THE CADDY

	Swerves into cross traffic, makes a big press forward. Comes
	abreast of the driver&#39;s side of the bus.

	GANZ

	Smashes a side window with the two handguns.

	Blasts away.

	Cates driving with one hand as he draws his gun.

	CATES

	Looks up as glass shards sparkle down.

	He speeds up ... he is neck and neck with the bus.

	Hammond has a clear shot of Billy Bear who gives a side
	glance at him;

	Hammond doesn&#39;t shoot...

	Cates slows down and fires...

	Billy is hit in the shoulder. Ganz runs up and fires again...
	Hammond is hit in the arm. Cates grabs Hammond by the shirt.
	Yanks him close. Throws the wheel over ...

	CADDY

	Swerves as bullets pepper the passenger side. Stuffing flies
	out of Hammondis still warm seat. The right hand windows
	explode. Then the Caddy spins out.

	THE BUS

	Roars away...

	THE CADDY

	Skids into a traffic sign, demolishing some newspaper
	machines. Cates curses, tries to start the car. The engine
	won&#39;t turn over. He looks at the distant bus.

					CATES
			Goddamn! Goddamn!  Goddamn!

	Pounds on the dash. What&#39;s left of the windshield falls in at
	the impact.

	TRANSITION.

	SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

	Cates at his desk. Hammond seated nearby, now with a bandaged
	arm.  Haden in front of Cates, furious.

					HADEN
			A bus, you goddamn whiskey mick
			cop, you lost a stolen bus... We
			got five deaths related to Ganz,
			all of &#39;em law enforcement
			related, and you blow it for a
			lousy nigger convict...

	Cates says nothing...

					HADEN
					 (continuing)
			That&#39;s rights I called him a
			nigger.  You bet I did ... I saw
			the report on that little piece of
			shit.  If he spent one legal day
			in his whole life, it&#39;d be a
			record...This is it for you...
			suspension, review board... you&#39;ve
			had it.  When it gets &#39;round you
			protect a con rather than nail a
			cop killer...

	Cates stands up.

					CATES
			He&#39;s got more brains and more guts
			in one corner of his asshole than
			any cop I&#39;ve worked with.

					HADEN
			Just cause you say it with
			conviction don&#39;t mean shit to
			me... How you gonna take to a pink
			slip, huh?.

	Cates stands. Moves to Hammond. Handcuffs himself to him.

					HADEN
					 (continuing)
			Where the Christ do you think
			you&#39;re going?

					CATES
			I&#39;m taking my prisoner back to
			jail.

	Hammond looks at Haden.

					HAMMOND
			Goin&#39; a little hard on him, aren&#39;t
			you?

					HADEN
			Go fuck yourself convict.

					HAMMOND
			You know for a man, you have very
			pretty brown eyes.

	Cates and Hammond walk out.

	UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

	Cates and Hammond walk stoically along a row of cars, arrive
	at Hammond&#39;s Porsche.

					HAMMOND
			Hey, how&#39;d my car get here?

					CATES
			I had it impounded.  Come on,
			we&#39;ll use it for haulin&#39; you back
			to the slam.

					HAMMOND
			Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz
			got away. Got all my money. It
			just don&#39;t seem right.

					CATES
			I don&#39;t know about you, but I
			could use a drink... I&#39;ll buy you
			one.  It&#39;ll be my good-bye present.

	Takes off Hammond&#39;s cuffs.  Looks at them.. Throws them away.

					HAMMOND
			Sorry we didn&#39;t do better, Jack.
			I feel like I let you down.

					CATES
			Naw, you didn&#39;t let me down.  It
			was a long shot all the way.  We
			gave &#39;em a good run at it.

					HAMMOND
			Yeah, but we didn&#39;t get &#39;em.

	They get in and drive off.

	TRANSITION.

	EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT

	The Porsche blasts by ... These men want a drink.

	TRANSITION.

	CHRONICLE RESTAURANT AND BAR - NIGHT

	Cates and Hammond walk in. It&#39;s late, the place is almost
	empty. The Bartender is a woman with her back to them
	conferring with a waitress about something.

					HAMMOND
			It&#39;s late, they&#39;re closing...

					CATES
			Don&#39;t worry about it.

	The barmaid turns around to take their order.  It&#39;s Elaine.

					ELAINE
			Hey, I don&#39;t believe it.

					CATES
			Hiya, kid.

					ELAINE
			I ought to have you and your
			friend thrown out...

					CATES
			Don&#39;t.  We&#39;ve had a hard night.

					ELAINE
			I can see that.  Pardon me for
			saying so, but you look like
			shit.  What happened?

					CATES
			We and my pal here have been
			taking it on the chin for the last
			few hours...

	Hammond looks at her. He nudges Cates.

					ELAINE
			Who the hell are you?

					HAMMOND
			Name&#39;s Hammond, Reggie Hammond.
			I heard a lot about you. And any
			friend of Jack&#39;s is a friend of
			mine.

	Gives her a big smile.

					ELAINE
			I&#39;m not so sure I can say the same
			thing...You don&#39;t look like a cop.

					HAMMOND
			Well, I been workin&#39; the other
			side of the street for the last
			few years.  And you don&#39;t exactly
			look like a shrink, wearin&#39; that
			dress...

					ELAINE
			Shrink major, not a shrink.

	She pours three glasses of cognac. A STRAGGLER at the end of
	the bar pipes up.

					STRAGGLER
			Hey, lady, a drink here.

					ELAINE
			We&#39;re closed.

					STRAGGLER
			Hey, what the hell?

	Elaine turns to him; it&#39;s short and sweet.

					ELAINE
			Drink your drink, pay up and get
			out.

					STRAGGLER
			You can&#39;t do this.  It&#39;s against...

					ELAINE
			Hey, just fuck off.  My friends
			have guns.

	Cates holds up his pistol. The man&#39;s eyes widen and he turns
	his angry move toward her into a skedaddle out of the bar.
	Elaine finishes drying a glass and approaches.

					ELAINE
					 (continuing)
			You real down?

					CATES
			I&#39;ve been better...Dead end.  No
			Ganz, no Indian.

	He finishes his drink, puts down the glass.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			I gotta call the station.

	Looks back at Hammond...

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			Don&#39;t run off anywhere, okay?
			I&#39;ve already got enough to worry
			about.

	Moves away.

					HAMMOND
			Hard man to live with.

					ELAINE
			How would you know?

					HAMMOND
			Hey, two days with him is enough.

					ELAINE
			That&#39;s no bull.

	She looks at him carefully. They both grin.

	CATES

	In the phone booth.

					CATES
			Is there any report ... No ...
			Just tell me... nothing..Yeah I
			figured... Okay, sure.

	Hangs up.

	ELAINE AND HAMMOND

	Cates returns...

					CATES
			Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No
			sign of the Indian.  Airport&#39;s
			clean.  Train station. Bus
			station.  Docks... Shit...

					ELAINE
			Ganz is going to be hard to track.
			Just a pure schizo ... wires all
			crossed... totally without any
			pattern... kill anybody... The
			Indian... himself... anybody...

					CATES
			How do you know?

					ELAINE
			Jack, it&#39;s all over the papers.
			He&#39;s an obvious type.  But this
			Indian...

	Hammond cuts in.

					HAMMOND
			He was the only one of my bunch
			that was my friend... He was
			loyal, went all the way for you...

					ELAINE
			In all due respect, he sounds kind
			of pathetic to me.  The kind of
			guy that runs home to his momma or
			some girlfriend.  Have you two ace
			detectives checked that out?

					CATES
			Yeah, well the only woman of the
			Indian&#39;s we ran into was shacked
			up with her dyke girlfriend.  I
			guess she went with him before she
			came outta the Closet ... They
			both looked mad enough to kill
			him...

					HAMMOND
			Yeah, too bad.  They were real
			nice lookin&#39; too...In bed
			together, hardly any clothes one
			watching TV...

					ELAINE
			What makes you think they were
			lesbians, or as you so quaintly
			put it, dykes?

					CATES
			Come on, they were a little old
			for a slumber party.

					ELAINE
			It might pay to reexamine a few of
			your more primitive notions.  I
			was in bed with a girlfriend
			watching TV last week, Jack, and
			one thing we know about me is I
			happen not to be a lesbian ...
			Now, if this Indian&#39;s girlfriend
			got upset when you came looking
			for him, it could just be she&#39;s
			still vulnerable to him.

					CATES
			So what?

					ELAINE
			When a guy hurts you, then comes
			back bleeding on his hands and
			knees, who knows, he might just be
			irrestible.

					CATES
			Hey, Come on, shrink time&#39;s over.
			They wouldn&#39;t go see some old
			girlfriend.

					ELAINE
			Oh, yeah, well look where you came
			when you were down and out.

					HAMMOND
			She&#39;s got a point there, Jack.

	Smiles. Cates reflects for a moment.

					CATES
			It&#39;s the only thing we got.

	He looks at Elaine.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			Whaddya think?

					ELAINE
			What do I know?  I&#39;m just a
			bartender.

					CATES
			Let&#39;s go, Reggie.

	He kisses Elaine.

					HAMMOND
			Do I get to kiss her too?

					CATES
			If she&#39;s right, and if you don&#39;t
			screw up.

	They exit the bar.

	TRANSITION.

	EXT.  STREET - CHINATOVIN - NIGHT

	Cates and Hammond hidden in a doorway which affords them a
	good view of the alley landing to Casey and Sally&#39;s apartment.

					HAMMOND
			What if your girl&#39;s theory turns
			out to be bullshit?  I mean, they
			could be in Rio de Janeiro.

					CATES
			I&#39;ve got to play it rough with
			them. If they know anything, I&#39;m
			gonna know it.

	A woman appears, turning out to be Casey carrying a shopping
	bag.

					HAMMOND
			Hey, there she is...

					CATES
			Whatever play I maker just back me
			up.

					HAMMOND
			If we run into Billy first, let me
			try and talk him in.

					CATES
			Sure, I&#39;ll give you a shot at it,
			but Ganz is mine.  You know, that
			big Indian plays it for keeps...

					HAMMOND
			Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain&#39;t
			no sweetheart... I wouldn&#39;t like
			it if this partnership ended
			before it gets started.

					CATES
			Partnership?

					HAMMOND
			Well, you got to admit we come a
			long way.

	Cates gives him a smile.

					CATES
			Let&#39;s just do it.

	APARTMENT STAIRWELL

	As Casey opens the door and starts toward the.stairs, Cates
	and Hammond come through the door and grab her. They are now
	on the ground floor stairwell.

					CATES
			I hear you&#39;ve got visitors.

					CASEY
			Would you guys...

					CATES
			No time for any of that crap any
			more, lady... I&#39;ll rip your lungs
			out if you don&#39;t answer fast.

	Cates has her by the shoulder and arm; he twists her like a
	vise...

					HAMMOND
			He means it...

	She looks at Cates, knows Hammond&#39;s correct.

					CASEY
			Don&#39;t kill him.  Please, just
			don&#39;t kill him.

	A long moment.

					CATES
			You and the other one, you&#39;re
			still Billy&#39;s girls. You always
			were his girls...

					CASEY
			Yeah.  Sure, i&#39;m crazy in love
			with him, who wouldn&#39;t be...

					CATES
			You&#39;re gonna help us take him.

					CASEY
			No chance.

					CATES
			He can live or die ... You let us
			in and he&#39;s got a chance to make
			it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.

	Casey&#39;s face is seared with pain at the thought of Billy
	dying.

					HAMMOND
			If you help use he&#39;s got a chance,
			lady.

					CASEY
			Billy&#39;s in the first room off the
			hall ... With rosalie ... He&#39;s
			makin&#39; her happy tonight.  You
			don&#39;t understand about the way it
			is with him, do ya?

					CATES
			Where&#39;s ganz?

					CASEY
			In the back.  Down the other
			corridor.

	Cates looks at Reggie.

					CATES
			Looks like you&#39;re gonna get your
			chance.

	They move upward...

	INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Cates is stealthily going to the end of the second corridor
	of the kitchen and living room area. That corridor turns at
	a sharp angle and goes to the back. Hammond is at the very
	front of that first corridor..at a door ... he shoves it back.

	INT. FIRST BEDROOM

	There is a bed and  Rosalie, undressed, is in it... Billy is
	seated on the edge of it... pants on, shirt off, pulling on
	his boots. Suddenly, Hammond is pointing a gun at him...

					HAMMOND
			Give it up, Billy.  You got no
			shot at it.

	Billy stands.

					ROSALIE
			Don&#39;t let him hurt met Billy.
			You&#39;re not gonna let &#39;em hurt me,
			are ya?

					BILLY
			He won&#39;t hurt you.  He ain&#39;t gonna
			do nothin&#39; to you, he&#39;s just after
			me.

					HAMMOND
			I&#39;m tellin&#39; ya, Billy, give it up.

					BILLY
			I never was much for bein&#39;
			rehabilitated.

	Billy looks at Hammond.  With lightning sudden quickness, he
	reaches and produces a huge Bowie knife from behind his back.
	Billy smiles, laughs...then with a sudden, awful roar, he
	leaps at Hamnond who unflinchingly fires his pistol.  The big
	slugs stop Billy cold and throw him back against the bed as
	Rosalie shrieks.

	INT. BACK BEDROOM

	Ganz, half-dressed, asleep, gun in hand, throws himself off
	the bed, pushes Sally out of the way ... opens the door and
	starts firing furiously down the corridor... He grabs the
	briefcase and runs to the window.

	INT. CORRIDOR/DOOWAY TO BACK BEDROOM

	Cates has ducked the bullets ... he is inching toward the
	door...

	He pulls it open...Ganz from the window fires another shot
	which almost gets him then vanishes down the fire escape...

	INT. BACK BEDROOM

	Sally gets to her feett yelling, runs at Cates as he appears
	and futilely tries to hit him....He throws her down on the
	bed as if she were a doll ... He goes to the window...

	EXT. FIRE ESCAPE

	Ganz peels down the fire escapes hits the ground. He stops
	for a second... Then Cates appears, Ganz fires a shot then
	starts to run. Cates keeps coming...

	INT. FIRST BEDROOM

	Hammond hears the gunfire, runs out of the room...

	CATES

	Dives down the fire escape.

	BATHROOM

	Hammond enters to find it empty of Ganz and Cates, only Sally
	crying hysterically ... He runs out.

	EXT. CHINATOWN STREET

	Ganz runs out the back alley ...Cates pursues...

	ALLEY

	Hammond runs down the stairs toward the front of the building.

	EXT. STREET

	Ganz runs, turns out of an alley onto a street baked with
	neon light. Cates pursues.

	EXT. FRONT OF CASEY&#39;S BUILDING

	Hammond runs out, turns down the adjoining street.

	CATES

	Following Ganz, holding him in sight, but unable to get a
	shot off...

	PARALLEL STREET

	Hammond running down a street near the one where Ganz is
	being chased...

	MAIN STREET

	Cates fires at Ganz ... Ganz ducks in a doorway...

	HAMMOND

	on his street hears the shot... he runs toward it, down a
	narrow alley between two buildings....

	EXT. DOORWAY AT END OF ALLEY

	Ganz hears footsteps approach from the opposite direction of
	Cates.  They move very close to where be is crouched... it is
	Hammond coming toward him... Ganz suddenly rolls a garbage
	can in his path, dropping him like a stone.

	CATES

	Comes toward where he expects to find Ganz... Ganz has his
	arm around Hammond&#39;s throat and his gun to his ear...

					GANZ
			Drop it... you come up against me,
			you&#39;re gonna lose...

	Hammond drops his gun.

					GANZ
					 (continuing)
			Hey, cop, come on...l got
			something for ya... come on...

	EXT.  MAIN STREET

	Cates comes out of the doorway from which he&#39;s fired...and
	comes into the middle of the street, gun up ... he puts it
	down when he sees Ganz with Hammond in jeopardy.  The hand
	that&#39;s around Hammond&#39;s throat also holds the black bag.
	Cates walks forward, his gun down at his side...

					GANZ
			After I get outta this, cop...I&#39;m
			gonna live forever...

					CATES
			I don&#39;t think you&#39;re gonna make it.

					GANZ
			Whaddya mean...I got your gun ...
			I got his money... I got
			everything...

					HAMMOND
			Give up.  He&#39;s crazy.  He&#39;ll kill
			us both.

	Cates still walking...

					GANZ
			He won&#39;t try it. He&#39;s a fucking
			chickenshit cop. They&#39;re all
			fucking wimps, right, Cates?

	They are now closer to each other. Ganz holding Hammond and
	the money...

					GANZ
					 (continuing)
			Okay, cop ... give me your gun and
			I&#39;ll let him live. Come on, Cates,
			you&#39;re real good at giving up your
			gun.

	Cates keeps the same methodical pace...

					CATES
			Sure...

	Suddenly, he crouches and fires twice. Hammond twists as Ganz
	also fires. Ganz is hit in the collarbone and driven ten feet
	backward. His grip on Hammond drops, Hammond dives to the
	ground, looks at Cates.

					HAMMOND
			Jesus Christ, I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d
			really do it. You are crazy.

	Ganz&#39; gun still in his hand, but his arm useless at his side.
	Cates is frozen in the crouch, ready to fire again.

	Ganz is in enormous pain holding his bleeding chest... A look
	of childish disbelief passes over his face.

					GANZ
			I got hit.  I can&#39;t believe it. I
			got shot.

					CATES
			You&#39;re done.  End of story.

					GANZ
			I ain&#39;t gonna beg for my life. It
			ain&#39;t cool.

	He runs at Cates full-speed, screaming, roaring, then is
	stopped by two more bullets that tear fist-sized holes in his
	chest. Cates rises from his crouch. Takes his gun out of
	Ganz&#39; now lifeless hand. Then goes over to Hammond...

					HAMMOND
			Yours?

	Cates raises the pistol.

					CATES
			Mine...

	Pause.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			You okay?

					HAMMOND
			Yeah.  But I wasn&#39;t there for a
			second.

					CATES
			You did pick a real strange time
			to go and be brave all on your
			own...

	Hammond smiles.

					HAMMOND
			Just tryin&#39; to get the money,
			Jack.  Just tryin&#39; to build up a
			few points on that merit system.

	Cates smiles back, picks up the black bag as they move off.

	TRANSITION.

	ELAINE&#39;S BATHROOM

	Cates in the tub, steam rushing from the water.

	Elaine sits on the porcelain edge as he splashes and soaps...

					ELAINE
			How&#39;d they take it back at
			headquarters?

					CATES
			Usual bullshit.  You make one
			smart move and everybody wants to
			be your friend... You know
			somethin&#39;, shootin&#39; guys sucks.
			Especially compared to this.

					ELAINE
			I&#39;ve been waiting a long time to
			hear you say that.

					CATES
			Yeah, bein&#39; a hard-ass all the
			time is a real drag, but it works.

	He reaches out, lifts his watch from his pile of clothes on
	the floor.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			Three more hours...

					ELAINE
			Where is he?

					CATES
			Promised I&#39;d turn my back while
			he... ah, never mind...

					ELAINE
			Tell me.

					CATES
			He&#39;s takin&#39; care of the same
			business I&#39;ll be takin&#39; care of -
			soon as I dry off.

	Elaine smiles, leans close.

					ELAINE
			You&#39;re impossible...

					CATES
			That&#39;s what I always say.

	TRANSITION.

	CANDY&#39;S ROOM - NIGHT

	Minimal crummy hotel room accommodations... Hammond is
	kissing her at the door, finishing buttoning all his buttons.

	He reaches for a wallet, gives her several bills.

					HAMMOND
			Here you go, baby.

					CANDY
			Hey, don&#39;t do that.  I said I
			wasn&#39;t a pro, remember?

					HAMMOND
			Hey, no, I&#39;m tryin&#39; to be nice.
			Buy yourself something pretty.
			I&#39;d do it, but I got to go.  I got
			this cop waitin&#39; for me...

	They kiss... it&#39;s pretty romantic... She opens the door for
	him.

	CORRIDOR

	She stands at the top of the stairs; as Hammond walks down,
	he calls back to her over his shoulder ...

					HAMMOND
			I&#39;ll be back in six months...
			Maybe I&#39;ll make an honest woman of
			you.

	He gives her a big sniile.

					HAMMOND
					 (continuing)
			I&#39;ll buy ya the best dinner in San
			Francisco...how&#39;d that be? Then
			we&#39;ll go dancin&#39;, okay?

					CANDY
			Now you&#39;re talkin&#39;. See ya...

	He moves off, still smiling, holding the black briefcase...

	STREET - NIGHT

	on a picturesque hill above the Haight. Cates standing near
	the wheel of Hammond&#39;s Porsche.  Hammond comes down the porch
	steps from the hotel.

					CATES
			Okay, reggie, start bustin&#39; my
			chops... Tell me how great you
			were with that chick.

					HAMMOND
			Hey, Jack, real men don&#39;t have to
			go in for that macho bullshit ...
			but I was fantastic.

			As a riatter of fact, I was so
			good, I may have my cock done in
			bronze.

	Cates holds up the black briefcase.

					CATES
			I guess this is what you want to
			talk about...All the pretty money
			that&#39;s inside here.

	Cates takes the case to the trunk, opens it, deposits the
	case, locks the trunk.

					HAMMOND
			Wait a minute, Cates.  I&#39;ve been
			waitin&#39; three years for that.  I
			don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair, man. What
			about the merit system.? You were
			gonnna give me a few thousand.

					CATES
			There&#39;s nothin&#39; to talk about.

	Another long exchange of looks. Then be hands Hammond the
	keys to the trunk.

					CATES
					 (continuing)
			It&#39;s your money.  It&#39;ll be here in
			six months when you get out.

					HAMMOND
			And you&#39;re tellin&#39; me you don&#39;t
			want any of this cash?

					CATES
			That&#39;s right. Not my style,
			Reggie..

					HAMMOND
			You are an awesomely weird cop.
			Sure wish there were more like you
			runnin&#39; around out here.

					CATES
			No, you don&#39;t. If I ever get word
			of you steppin&#39; over the line
			again, I&#39;m gonna ventilate that
			suit of yours.

					HAMMOND
			Spare met Jack. I&#39;m into legit
			investments from here on in.

	Cates gives him a very skeptical look, as they head for the
	car.

	Hammond gets in behind the wheel, Cates on the passenger side.

	Cates takes out a cigarette, starts to light it.

	Hammond takes the match does it for him.

					CATES
			Thanks.

					HAMMOND
			No trouble, Jack. But, listen,
			suppose I stay a crook?  Where&#39;d
			you get the idea that you could
			catch me?

	They both smile. Hammond socks it into gear and they drive
	off into the far distance...

FADE IN:

1	EXT.  DESERT  NILE RIVER  VALLEY - DAY

	Somewhere in the Nile at the edge of the desert.

	CREDITS  ROLL

	WRITTEN:	EGYPT 1913

	OMAR and his mule zigzag along the bottom of sun scorched dunes.

2	EXT.  TEMPLE  EXCAVATION - DAY

	The mule and the boy finally reach a camp.  A few tents dwarfed by a huge
temple door jutting out of the sand.  The camp is deserted except for
some kids by the temple entrance holding large mirrors, reflecting light
into the temple.
	Omar leaves his mule in the shade, seizes two goatskins and slips inside
the temple.

3	INT.  TEMPLE - DAY

	Omar makes his way uneasily down a pillared corridor that opens into a
vast room where an old scientist stands on a small wooden ladder in front of
the wall across the room.  PROFESSOR MASSIMO PACOLI. A young man is beside
him, BILLY MASTERSON, age 25, an American student. He has a large sketchpad in
his hands.  Behind them AZIZ, age 10, whose job is to hold the last
mirror which shines light into the expansive room.

						PROFESSOR
					(deciphering)
				&quot;..when the three planets are in eclipse..&quot;

	His fingers trace across the wall which is covered with symbols and
strange hieroglyphs as he deciphers.

						PROFESSOR
				&quot;..the black hole like a door is open...
				Evil comes ... sowing terror and chaos...&quot;
				See?  The snake, Billy.  The Ultimate Evil
				... make sure you get the snake!

	The Professor points emphatically to the snake, the symbol of Evil,
coming through the door between the three planets in eclipse.  C.U.
Billy&#39;s hand sketches the snake quickly.  He is a natural artist.

						BILLY
				And when is this door opening snake act
				supposed to occur?

	The Professor&#39;s fingers touch the signs.

						PROFESSOR
				..if this is the five..and this the thousand..

	He calculates.

						PROFESSOR
				Every five thousand years..

						BILLY
					(kidding)
				So I have some time..

	He reaches for the pad.

	ANGLE ON:  Omar.  Standing at the entrance to the chamber with the water
bag, entranced by the sight.  A skeletal hand falls on his shoulder.  Omar
turns to an ancient PRIEST in a rough milled black cannock.

						PRIEST
				I will take it to them my son.

	Startled but obedient, Omar gives the water bag to the Priest.

						PRIEST
				Go with God.. be safe from Evil..

	The Priest makes the sign of the Cross on the boy&#39;s forehead, dismissing
him.
	As soon as he is gone, the Priest turns a worried eye to the Professor.

	ANGLE ON:  The Professor is back to translating, Billy to sketching.

						PROFESSOR
				&quot;..then arrange the elements of life against
				the Terror just so..&quot;

	His fingers run on.

						PROFESSOR
				&quot;..Water..fire..earth..air..four
				elements around the fifth..&quot;

	His fingers fall on the one element that has a human shape, surrounded by
all the others.

	The Priest opens the water skin and begins to pour a vial of powder into
the skin.

	ANGLE ON:  Aziz falling asleep.  The mirror falls, the light fails.

						PROFESSOR
				Aziz!  Light!

	The boy struggles to stay awake.  The mirror comes up.

						PRIEST
				Lord forgive me.. they already know too,
				much..

						PROFESSOR
				&quot;..in which all the history of the Universe resides
				..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from
Evil..&quot;

						PRIEST (V.O.)
				Amen..

	The Professor turns to the Priest who is pouring water into a tin cup
from the skin.

						PROFESSOR
				Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing..
				the greatest find in history..can you imagine
				the implications.

						PRIEST
				Only too well... here you must be
				parched..

	He hands the cup to the Professor.  The Professor takes it, has it almost
to his lips when..

						PROFESSOR
				I mean look.. it is like a battle plan..

	In his excitement he does not drink, much to the Priest&#39;s chagrin.

						PROFESSOR
				Here the Good.. Here the Evil..

	As the Priest looks up, Aziz the mirror  boy, tips his mouth under the
water skin, drinking the leakage.

						PROFESSOR
				Here..

	He points to the Five Elements.

						PROFESSOR
				A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am
				going to be famous.

						PRIEST
				Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..

	The Priest hands Billy a cup.

						PRIEST
				Drink!

						PROFESSOR
				To fame.. salud..

	The Professor raises the cup to drink, and then...

						PROFESSOR
				We cannot toast with water.. Billy !
				In my sack.. the Grappa!

	The Priest watches, disconsolate, as the Professor tosses away his water.
Billy finishes his cup before running off into the tunnel.

4	EXT.  COLONNADE - DAY

	A muffled SOUND grows steadily louder. Outside, a monstrous linear shadow
disturbs the kid&#39;s game and gradually darkens the temple entrance.

5	INT.  TUNNEL - DAY

	Billy is looking for the grappa in the Professor&#39;s bag.  He comes upon a
machine pistol.  When the muffled SOUND suddenly grabs his attention.  He
leans toward the corridor and sees part of a spaceship appear.  Billy is
paralyzed.

6	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The Professor keeps reading over the inscription.

						PROFESSOR
				&quot;..this perfect person.. this perfect
				being..&quot; I do not understand this.. perfect?

						PROFESSOR
				Where is that boy? Billy!

7	INT.  TUNNEL - DAY

	Billy presses himself against the wall, in the shadows, terrified, but
sketching away like mad, as large shadowed figures lumber past him.  He
begins to blink, feeling the effects of the Priest&#39;s potion..

8	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The Professor reads the wall.

						PROFESSOR
				And this divine Light they talk
				about.. what is Divine light?

	At that moment, the reflection from Aziz&#39;s mirror drops again.  The light
fails.

						PROFESSOR
					(without turning)
				Aziz light!

	The room is flooded with light all of the sudden.

						PROFESSOR
				Better.. this is the most unbelievable thing
				I have ever seen..

	The Professor turns around, and is stunned speechless to find himself
face to face with two MONDOSHAWANS.  A dozen others fill the hall manning
the source of the light, large luminous globes.  Aziz is fast asleep.

						PROFESSOR
					(uncomprehending)
				...Uh, yes?

	The Professor is lifted up and carried off to the side by the aliens.
The KOMMANDER stops in front of the Priest who is still on his knees, face
to the ground.

						PRIEST
				Master... He was about to discover everything,
				but I had the situation under control.

	The two MONDOSHAWAN GUARDS hold the professor three feet off the ground.

						PROFESSOR
					(in a panic)
				Who are you?  Are you Germans?  Sprechen
				Sie Deutsch?

9	INT.  TUNNEL

	Billy staggers forward, a machine pistol in his hand.

10	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM

	The KOMMANDER holds out his hand to the Priest.

						PRIEST
				What did I do wrong?

	The Priest jumps to his feet excitedly.

						KOMMANDER
				Servant, you and the thousand guards
				before you... You have done your work well,
				but we have to recover the elements. War will
				soon engulf your planet. We must keep them safe.

	The Kommander goes over to the wall and seems to be looking for a lock.
He finds it and slides in his metallic finger which is more intricate
than a key to a safe.  He turns his hand, activating a mechanism that opens
the wall.

						PROFESSOR
				Unbelievable!!!

	The Kommander turns around and crooks a finger.  One of the MONDOSHAWANS
	waves his hand, puts the professor to sleep and heads down the hallway
revealed by the opening.  He is followed by his men.  The Priest slips in
behind them.

11	INT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAY

	The Kommander steps into a vast room.  The ceiling is very high, pyramid-
shaped.  In each corner of the room, four vessels contain four
rectangular twelve-inch stones-, the four elements.  In the middle, an
opaque sarcophagus rests on an altar.  The Kommander stops and
contemplates it a moment.

						PRIEST
					(to himself)
				The Fifth Element...

						KOMMANDER
				Take them and put them in a safe place.

	His men carry out his order.

12	INT.  ROOM 1  TEMPLE - DAY

	Billy staggers across the floor, struggling to stay awake.

13	INT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAY

	The Kommander opens a case.  His men come and put the four, precious
stones in it, one by one.

						PRIEST
					(moved)
				Will the elements be gone now forever
				from this place?

						KOMMANDER
				When mankind comes to its senses.
				We will return.

						PRIEST
				Knowing mankind as I do, that could take
			centuries!

						KOMMANDER
				Time is of no importance, only life
				is important.

	The Priest nods and lowers his eyes.

	Angle on:  Billy staggering forward, raising his pistol, blinking his
eyes to focus..

	A MONDOSHAWAN puts the fourth element in the case The Kommander shuts the
	case and looks at the Priest.

						KOMMANDER
				When EVIL returns so shall we.

						PRIEST
					(head lowered)
				We will be ready, Lord.

	Billy suddenly staggers into the room, brandishing his gun.

						BILLY
				Stop.

	Billy trips, the gun goes off.  He empties the clip.  The Mondoshawan
carrying the case crumples to the ground.  The wall immediately begins to
close.  Billy fires wildly, unable to control the powerful kicking gun.

						PRIEST
				No!!!  Don&#39;t!!!

	The Priest rushes Billy.  The weapon has such a kick to it that Billy
starts shooting into the air, backs up, then stumbles and knocks himself
out.  The Priest is on the ground, seriously wounded.  So is the Kommander.
The WARRIORS are in a panic.

						CLERK
				Hurry, Kommander!  The wall&#39;s closing!!!

	The wall continues to close.  Sand pours in from everywhere.  The vast
room fills up like an hourglass.

						KOMMANDER
				A mission is a mission, Savoia.
				You&#39;ll learn that.

	The Kommander picks up the case and reaches the wall but can&#39;t get
through it.  His
	armor is too bulky, the opening too small.  He manages to get his arm and
the case through.

						KOMMANDER
				My apologies to General Kroi -- and my wife..

	The wall closes, crushing his arm.  The CLERK scoops up the case and runs
	through the huge piles of sand.

14	EXT.  COLONNADE - DAY

	The CLERK boards the ship carrying the case.  Omar hides in a corner,
frightened to death, hugging Billy&#39;s bag of drawings.

15	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The room fills with sand.  The Priest&#39;s body is soon buried.

16	EXT.  DESERT - DAY

	The huge ship&#39;s main hatch closes.

17	EXT.  TEMPLE - DAY

	The ship lifts off and speeds away. Omar emerges from the temple gaping
at the ship as it vanishes in the sky.

18	EXT.  PYRAMIDS

	A gigantic shooting star flashes above the pyramids.

19	EXT.  EARTH  ORBIT

	The ship passes in front of us and heads for the stars disappearing at
unbelievable speed.  The background is a star-spattered cosmos.

	WRITTEN:	500 YEARS LATER

	Another, more modern, spaceship, fills the screen.  A warship belonging
to the Federal Army.

20	INT.  SPACESHIP  CONTROL  ROOM

	CU of a digital control screen.  Three planets projecting three straight
lines that crisscross at one point.  Identical to the one observed by the
professor on the temple wall.  GENERAL STAEDERT looks out through the
ship&#39;s window at one of the three huge planets in eclipse.

						STAEDERT
				Don&#39;t you have anything?  Not even
				a temperature?

						CAPTAIN
				The thermo-analyzers have jammed.
				One of them reads over a million degrees,
				the other&#39;s at minus 5000...
				Never seen anything like it.

						TECHNICIAN
				It&#39;s taking shape.

21	EXT.  SPACE

	In the middle of the shadows, a door to the nightmare has just opened.
Evil is back.  A round, moving mass, continually changing color.

						CAPTAIN
					(in awe)
				What the hell can it be?

						TECHNICIAN
				Hook-up with the president in one
				minute, General.

	General Staedert remains calm.

						STAEDERT
				...Send out a probe.

22	INT.  PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE  MANHATTAN

	LINDBERG, 50, the president of the United Federations, his features lined
and worn by various delegations, mainly military, enters his office.
There&#39;s a crisis in the air.  The President&#39;s AIDE leans down to his ear.

						AIDE
				On air in 30 seconds.

	In the middle of the group is a Priest whose appearance reminds us of
Egypt.  A younger man DAVID, 18, shy, a priest-in-training attends the old
man.

23	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE

						CAPTAIN
				President on line sir..

	General Staedert leans over his screen and seems surprised to see the
room but not the president.

						PRESIDENT (O.S.)
				Staedert, do you read me?

						STAEDERT
				I can hear you, Mr. President, but I
				can&#39;t see you .

	The President grabs the mini-camera on his desk and yanks it around to
face him.
	His face fills the screen.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				Is that better?

						STAEDERT
				Perfect, Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
				I have to address the Supreme Council
				in 10 minutes.
				Just the facts, General.

						STAEDERT
				There are no results from the chemical
				and molecular analysis as of yet, all the
				calibers are overshot..we&#39;re hoping a
				thermo nucleatic imaging..

						PRESIDENT
				(exasperated)
				What you are saying is you don&#39;t know
				what this..thing..is.

	Consternation reigns in the President&#39;s office.

						STAEDERT
				Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is
				it just keeps getting bigger!

						PRESIDENT
				Options.

						STAEDERT
				Wait or act.

						PRESIDENT
				Recommendations.

						STAEDERT
				My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first
				ask questions later.
				I don&#39;t like uninvited guests.

						PRESIDENT
				Gentlemen?

						HEAD CHEMISTS
				I think it would be foolish to shoot at an
				organism that seems alive, without first
				taking the time to study it more!
				Besides, it has shown no signs of hostility.

						PRESIDENT
					(worried)
				No... it&#39;s just getting bigger.

						HEAD CHEMISTS
				So do people, but that&#39;s no reason to shoot
				them.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				The security of the Federated Territories is
				and remains number one priority.
					(to the military)
				I suppose General Staedert&#39;s &quot;philosophy&quot; is
				acceptable to you?

	All the Generals nod &quot;yes&quot;

						PRESIDENT
				All right, then! Staedert?

						PRIEST (O.S.)
				Mr. President?

	The President scans the room. Staedert remote controls the camera toward
the room.

						PRESIDENT
				...Yes?

	The camera moves up the Priest and we finally discover his face.  He is
in his sixties, a shrewd look in his eyes.
	Around his neck hangs the Kommander&#39;s finger, the key to the temple.

						PRIEST
				Cornelius, Vito Cornelius. 50th level parish.
				I have a different theory to offer you,
				Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
				I&#39;m listening.

						CORNELIUS
				Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not
				anything that can be identified because it prefers
				not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are.
				Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.

						PRESIDENT
					(a little sarcastically)
				One more reason to shoot first eh?

	All the Generals nod in agreement.

						CORNELIUS
				Evil begets evil, Mr. President.
				Shooting would only make it stronger.

24	INT.  SPACESHIP

						TECHNICIAN
				The probe will attain its objective in
				five seconds.

	Staedert moves closer to the ship&#39;s window.

25	EXT.  SPACE.

	Evil swallows the probe and immediately bubbles over with activity like a
furious volcano.

26	INT.  PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE

						STAEDERT
				Mr. President, we&#39;re at crisis point.

	The President looks puzzled.

						PRESIDENT
				Your theory is interesting Father but
				I don&#39;t think we have time to go into it
				right now!

						CORNELIUS
				Time is of no importance, Mr. President.
				Only life is important.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				That&#39;s exactly what we are going to try and do:
				Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our
				fellow citizens! General?
				You may fire when ready.

27	INT.  SPACESHIP

						STAEDERT
					(cold) (to the CAPTAIN)
				..Up front loading of a 120 ZZR missile.
				Marker lights on the objective.

28	EXT.  OUTSIDE  SPACESHIP

	All of a sudden, outside the ship, the strange planet&#39;s activity ceases.
A black crust immediately covers it.

29	INT.  PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE

						SCIENTIST
					(consulting new data)
				Its structure has just solidified on the surface,
				 as if the object felt something.  If that&#39;s the case,
				we are undoubtedly dealing with an intelligence.

						CORNELIUS
				The most terrible intelligence imaginable,
				Mr. President.

	The President hesitates.

						CAPTAIN
				...The ship is in combat formation.
				The missile is loaded, General.

						PRESIDENT
					(uneasy)
				Staedert?  Give me a minute...
				I have a doubt.

						STAEDERT
					(cold)
				I don&#39;t, Mr. President.

30	EXT.  OUTSIDE  SPACESHIP

	The missile explodes from the ship and penetrates its target.  The
explosion is swallowed like a fizzy pill in a small glass of water.
Nothing happens.  And then the mass grows larger.

31	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE

	Staedert looks worried.

						STAEDERT
				Load a series of 740 missiles. Maximum
				shield protection.

						CAPTAIN
				Yes, Sir.

	The President is growing ever more worried.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert?  What&#39;s going on?  Did you
				destroy it?

						STAEDERT
				I&#39;m about to, Mr. President.

32	EXT.  SPACESHIP

	A series of three missiles heads for the planet, which absorbs them all.
And literally doubles in size.

						SCIENTIST
				The planet&#39;s diameter has greatly
				increased and it&#39;s moving toward the ship.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert?  Get out of there immediately!
				I don&#39;t want an incident, do you hear me,
				Staedert?

						STAEDERT
					(worried)
				...What do we have that&#39;s bigger than 240?

						CAPTAIN
				Nothing, General.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert, get out of there!  That&#39;s an order!

	A bead of sweat pearls Staedert&#39;s forehead. He is about to give an order
when a gigantic flame emerges from the planet and literally swallows
Staedert&#39;s spaceship.

						STAEDERT
					(eyes wide)
				... Good God!

	The flame fills the screen with a horrendous NOISE that....

33	INT.  APARTMENT

	... wakes up a man trying to escape from a nightmare. KORBEN DALLAS rubs
his head.  Thirty five years old, short hair, powerfully built,
unquestionable charm, good looking in spite of the scars here and there.
The alarm clock is still ringing, it shows the date as March 18, 2359.  It
in two in the morning. Ha grabs a cigarette, and stops to look for a
light.  He shuts oft the alarm.  He hears a cat mewing in the hall.  But it
	still rings.  Korben takes a moment and then realizes it in the phone
that is ringing.

						KORBEN
					(to the cat)
				I&#39;m coming.

	He grabs the phone and crosses his tiny apartment (27 feet long by 6 feet
wide) heading for the door, patting himself for a light.  Behind him, the
bed makes itself automatically.

						KORBEN
					(on the phone)
				Yeah?

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Hey bud! Finger here.

	He opens the door for the cat and starts to rummage through a drawer for
a match. Out come a handful of war decorations, a hero&#39;s collection.

						KORBEN

					(to the cat)
				Hi sweetie!

	...A Medal of Honor Certificate to Major Dallas

						FINGER (V.O.)
				I love you too Major, but you haven&#39;t called
				me that since basic training.

						KORBEN
				I was talking to the cat.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer
				your cat to the real thing.

	...A picture of Korben and his ex-wife on their wedding day.

						KORBEN
				At least, the cat comes back.

						FINGER (V.O.)
					(ironical)
				You still pining for that two timing bitch.
				Forget her.
				There are a million women out there.

						KORBEN
				I don&#39;t want a million - I just want
				one.  A perfect one.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Don&#39;t exist bud.

	...A picture of Korben and Finger in uniform next to a space fighter.

						KORBEN
				I just found a picture of you.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				How do I look?

						KORBEN
				Like shit.

	Korben finds a box of matches with three matches.  He strikes one. It
does not light.  Korben opens the fridge, bare, except for an empty can of
GEMINI croquettes.
	On the packet is an ad:
	WIN A DREAM TRIP FOR 2 TO FHLOSTON PARADISE.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				 Must be an old picture.. Listen, you gotta bring
				me your hack for the 6 month overhaul.  A.S.A.P.

	Korben heats up some brackish water.

						KORBEN
					(sighs)
				I don&#39;t need one.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				You forgetting who sat next to you for
				a thousand missions.
				I know how you drive.

						KORBEN
				Finger!  I&#39;m driving a cab now, not a
				space fighter!!

						FINGER (V.O.)
				How many points you got left on your
				license?

						KORBEN
					(lying)
				Uh... at least fifty.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				In your dreams! See you tonight!

	Finger has hang up.  Korben sighs and does the same.  He gets the heated
brackish water and sits down.  The cat pounces on the table and meows for
its food.  Korben pours half the coffee in the cat&#39;s cup.

	The cat meows.  Korben taps his cup to the cat&#39;s saucer.

						KORBEN

	The office is emptied, only a few army officers remain.  An ancient
manuscript, Billy&#39;s drawings, sits in front of the President.  Cornelius
turns page after page, illustrating his
	point.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the President)
				We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs
				to adapt itself to our living conditions.

						PRESIDENT
					(worried)
				And then?

						CORNELIUS
				And then it will be too late. The goal of
				evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life.
				For all eternity...Life upsets it.

	The President appears upset himself by this image.

						PRESIDENT
				Is there anything that can stop it?

						CORNELIUS
					(knowing)
				Yes..thank God..

39	INT.  PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE

	The manuscript is open on the President&#39;s desk.. CLOSE ON:
	Billy&#39;s rendering of the Mondoshawan.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the President)
				The Mondoshawans don&#39;t belong to the
				Federated Territories, but they are peaceful...
				in their possession are the four elements of life.
				These elements when they are gathered around a fifth:
				The Supreme Being, ultimate warrior, created to protect
				life......

	The SUPREME BEING is standing, as if frozen in armor.  All we see is the
bottom half of his body.  Big metallic gloves hold the case engraved with
the emblem of the three suns containing the four Sacred Stones.

						CORNELIUS
				..will produce what the ancients called the
				light of creation, the light of total goodness
				which is the only thing that can defeat EVIL.

	The President points to the spot occupied by the 5th element.

						PRESIDENT
				But what happens if instead of
				this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL
				who stands here?

						CORNELIUS
				White turns to black.  Light to Dark.
				Life to Death.  For all eternity.

	The President&#39;s nerves quiver.

						CAPTAIN
				Sir, we have a Mondoshawan spaceship at
				the frontier requesting permission to enter
				 our territory.

						PRESIDENT
				I guess I should make a decision..

						CORNELIUS
				They are the only ones who can help..

						GENERAL
				Sir..the Mondoshawan do not belong to the
				federation. We do not know their intention..
				I must recommend a full trinuclear assault..

						PRESIDENT
					(yells)
				Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship
				like a gum drop?  You can&#39;t even tell me what it is!
				I ask you for options you give me bullshit.
				Give them permission to enter our territories
				with my warmest regards.

						CORNELIUS
					(relieved)
				Thank you, Mr. President.

	The MONDOSHAWAN spaceship zips across the Federated Galaxy.
	But it is not alone: Two black warships seem to be dogging it.

43	INT.  MONDOSHAWAN  COCKPIT

	The MONDOSHAWANS have spotted the spacecraft chasing them.

						FIRST OFFICER
				Two non-identified ships approaching.

						CAPTAIN
				Must be the welcoming committee.

44	INT.  WARSHIP  COCKPIT

	A MANGALORE sits at the controls of the warship. His terrifying features
tell us what sort of welcome they can expect.  The pilot fires without
warning.

	The huge ship is badly hit and immediately swerves oft course.
	Panic aboard the MONDOSHAWAN ship.

	Blast after blast hits the defenseless ship.

	The huge ship veers oft course and heads for a small red planet, taking
hit after hit.

						CAPTAIN
				Send out a distress signal!!! Activate

	The huge ship approaches the planet at blinding speed.

						FIRST OFFICER
				Impact in less than ten seconds!

	The red planet looms ever closer.

						CAPTAIN
				Time is of no importance...

	The ship crashes in a gigantic explosion.

46A	INT.  KORBEN&#39;S  APARTMENT - DAY

	A thermo nuclear explosion fills a T.V. screen..Which Korben&#39;s cat
watches with interest.

	Korben is about to exit the apartment.

						KORBEN
				Don&#39;t watch it all day, it&#39;ll rot your
				mind. Bye sweetie..

	In response, the cat meows.  Korben opens the door to..A huge
	gun, brandished by a nervous MUGGER, pointing right in his face.

						MUGGER
				The cash man!

						KORBEN
				Been here long?

						MUGGER
				Don&#39;t fuck with me man or I&#39;ll blow
				you into tomorrow!

	Unperterbed, Korben looks at the mugger&#39;s fearsome weapon.

						KORBEN
				Isn&#39;t that a Z140? Alleviated titanium.
				Neuro charged assault model?

						MUGGER
					(off balance)
				Uh..

						KORBEN
				You know you could hurt someone with
				this puppy..good thing it&#39;s not loaded..

	The mugger is lost.  He looks at his weapon.

						MUGGER
				It&#39;s not?

						KORBEN
				You gotta push the little yellow button...

	Korben points to the button on the side of the gun.  The mugger takes his
advice.

						MUGGER
				Thanks..

						KORBEN
				You&#39;re welcome..

	And with lightning speed, Korben blasts the mugger with a straight right
hand, sending him down for the count.  Korben retrieves the gun.

						KORBEN
				..you know these things are VERY illegal..
				you could get in a shit load of trouble..
				I better hang onto it for you..

	As the mugger clears his head, Korben opens a drawer next to him which is
full of similar guns! The mugger&#39;s eyes pop out of his head.  He scampers
to his feet and runs off.

	Korben shrugs, exits his apartment, and closes the door.  The cat watches
a nuclear holocaust on T.V.,  uninterrupted.

46B	INT.  KORBEN&#39;S  GARAGE - DAY

	Korben enters his taxi.  A robotic voice greets him.

						VOICE
				Please enter your license..

	Korben complies, and starts to push a series of buttons on the dash.

						VOICE
				Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..

						KORBEN
				How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK?
				I didn&#39;t.

	Korben hits a button.  The garage door starts to open.

						VOICE
				Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...

						KORBEN
				I had the worst goddamn nightmare.

						VOICE
				You have nine points left on your license..

						KORBEN
				Thanks for reminding me..

	As the garage door lifts, the Megalopolis that is New York City in the
23rd century comes into view.  Startling in it&#39;s height, and breath.

						VOICE
				Have a nice day..

	Korben lets the propulsion build.

						KORBEN
				Right..

	He lets the gear slip.  The taxi rockets off into the City.

				We are lost!

						GENERAL MUNRO
				Mr. President, the attack was launched by two
				unregistered warships.

						PRESIDENT
				Close all borders and declare a state of
				general alert.

						GENERAL MUNRO
				Yes, sir.

						PRESIDENT
					(to another OFFICER)
				Try to contact these Mondoshawans.  We
				owe them an explanation.

						CORNELIUS
					(lost, to himself)
				What are we going to do?

						PRESIDENT
				This is government business now.
				You ought to go home and get some
				rest, Father.

	The President motions to his guards to come and get Cornelius.

						PRESIDENT
				I promise to keep you informed.

	A weary Cornelius leaves the room with David&#39;s help.

						PRESIDENT
					(to the CAPTAIN)
			...Has the rescue team found any survivors?

50	EXT.  RED  PLANET - OMIT

52	INT.  LABORATORY  1ST DISTRICT  MANHATTAN - DAWN

	An arm, on a surgical cart, moves down the hall of the Nucleological
Center, the most sterile of environments.

	PROFESSOR MACTILBURGH, age 60, hurries alongside GENERAL MUNRO.

						MUNRO
				This is all that survived?

						MACTILBURGH
				Actually only one cell survived..

						MUNRO
				Have you identified it?

						MACTILBURGH
				It&#39;s not that easy..we&#39;ve never encountered
				anything like it before..you see normal human
				beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is
				more than enough for any species to perpetuate
				itself..This one has 200,000.

						MUNRO
				Talk English Doc.

						MACTILBURGH
				This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite
				genetic knowledge stored inside.
				Almost like it was...engineered.

						MUNRO
				Sounds like a freak of nature to me.

						MACTILBURGH
				Yes... I can&#39;t wait to meet him.

	They pass into the lab.

53	INT.  LABORATORY

	The two enter a cylindrical laboratory.  There is a huge glass turbine in
the middle with the metal glove inside.  A DNA chain scrolls on the computer
screen.

						MACTILBURGH
					(rather fascinated)
				The compositional elements of his DNA
				chain are the same as ours, there are simply
				more of them tightly packed.
				His knowledge is probably limitless..

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?

						MACTILBURGH
				We put it through the cellular hygiene detector.
				The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.

	Munro hesitates a moment.  Then he sighs and uses his personal key to
open the
	self-destruct box.

						MUNRO
				OK, go ahead! But Mr. Perfect better be polite...
				otherwise I turn him into cat food.

	Mactilburgh starts the operation rolling as Munro puts his hand on the
sell-destruct button, ready to use it.  Thousands of cells form in the
heart of the generator, an assemblage of DNA elements.  Then the cells move
down a tube, like a fluid, and gather in an imprint of a HUMAN body.  Step
by step bones are reconstructed, then the nervous and muscular systems.
Whole veins wrap around the muscles.  An entire body is reconstructing before
our very eyes.

						DOCTOR
				Three seconds to ultra-violet protection.

	A shield comes over the reconstructing body and makes it invisible.

						MACTILBURGH
					(to Munro)
				...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction
				of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly
				greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells
				to react, to protect themselves.
				That means growing skin. Clever, eh?

						MUNRO
					(disgusted)
				Wonderful!

	The meter slows, drops to zero.

						ASSISTANT
				... End of reconstruction, beginning of
				reanimation .

	A whoosh of air in the glass chamber.  Captain Munro has his hand on the
self-destruct button, ready to destroy the being that has barely been
reborn.

						MACTILBURGH
					(pushing a button)
				Activate life support system.

	An electrical discharge fills the glass chamber causing the body inside
to jerk.
	After a few moments of silence, the SOUND of a heartbeat fills the room
over the loudspeaker.

						ASSISTANT
				Life support system activated.

	The Supreme Being is alive once again.

						MACTILBURGH
				Remove the shield.

	The ASSISTANT automatically removes the ultra-violet shield which slowly
reveals... a woman... nude... young... and very beautiful.  Munro stands there
gaping.  Not quite his vision of the Supreme Being.  Mactilburgh glances
at Munro and gently pushes his hand away from the self-destruct button.

						MACTILBURGH
					(with a smile)
				I told you ... perfect!

	Munro is hypnotized by the GIRL&#39;s beauty.

						MUNRO
				...I&#39;d, uh , like to get a few pictures for the
archives
				before she wakes up.

	Mactilburgh looks at him with a grin.  A remote-control camera approaches
the girl&#39;s face, a flash goes off.  Blinded by the flash, the girl jumps and
screams.  She cowers in a corner, shaking from the cold, darting eyes
everywhere looking for the case she was holding.

						GIRL
					(very angry)
				Ouacra cocha o dayodomo binay ouacra
				mo cocha ferji akba ligounai makta keratapla.
				Tokemata tokemata!  Seno santonoi-aypa!
				Minoi ay Cheba!  Givomana seno!

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				What&#39;s she saying?

						MACTILBURGH
					(to his ASSISTANT)
				Activate the phonic detector.

	The girl kicks the window repeatedly.

						MACTILBURGH
				And give her a light sedative...
				and something to wear!

	The ASSISTANT hits a button.  A pile of clothes drops out of a trapdoor
in the ceiling.  She snatches up the clothes angrily and dresses quickly.
Munro draws closer to the glass window.  He watches her dress with
undisguised pleasure.

						MUNRO
					(to Mactilburgh)
				This thing solid?

						MACTILBURGH
					(smiling)
				An elephant couldn&#39;t crack it.

	The Girl finishes dressing.

						GIRL
					(angrily)
				Teno akta chataman assin-omekta!

	Munro smiles safely behind his plate glass window.

						MUNRO
					(with a smile)
				You&#39;re gonna have to learn to communicate
				better than that angel if you want out.

	Munro dangles the key on a chain that will let her out.  The girl rams
her fist right through the window.  She grabs the key and yanks it.  The
chain snaps tight and Munro slams into the window knocking himself out.  The
girl puts her hand through the window again, unlocks the chamber and steps
out.  She is still bit wobbly on her legs.  Two GUARDS try to grab her.
She sends them flying across the room. Mactilburgh is most impressed.  He
sets off a general alarm.

54	INT.  CORRIDOR  LABORATORY

	The girl runs through a maze of corridors looking for a way out.  A squad
of SECURITY GUARDS appear in front of her and open fire without warning. The
girl takes a leap, grabs an air vent, kicks it out and dives into the air
shaft.  The COPS try and jump up to the vent, but none can reach it.

						CHIEF
				Get me a chair or a stepladder The rest of you
				go through the main ventilation!

55	INT.  VENTILATION DUCT  LABORATORY

	The girl moves along unable to see what&#39;s ahead of her. She comes to a
dead-end, a grill that leads outside.  She pushes it out and exits onto
the ledge.

56	EXT.  LEDGE  LABORATORY - DAWN

	She has exited to a ledge on the 450th floor of a building, right in the
middle of Manhattan, which we discover for the first time.  The city has
become monstrous. Buildings rise 600 stories.  Cars fly.  Subways run
vertically...The girl edges along the narrow ledge, unfazed by the height.
The CHIEF leans out the vent, looking out into the void.

						CHIEF
					(to his men)
				Go on follow her!

	The COPS stare into the gaping void.

						COP
				...No way.

	The CHIEF angrily pulls out his gun and shoots at the girl who ducks
around the corner of the building.  Unfortunately the other side in full of
cops as well.  A flying police car zooms up in front of her, sirens
blaring.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This in the police.  Your status is illegal.
				Please put up your hands and follow our
				instructions!

	The girl feels trapped.  She looks down into the endless 450 below and
all the cars flying underneath her.  Then she raises her arms... and dives
off.

57	INT.  POLICE  CAR - NIGHT

						COP
					(in the car.)
				Christ! She dove off!

	In a panic, the COP makes a wrong turn.  The girl falls for several
seconds.
	She lands on the roof of a flying cab.

58	INT.  CAB - NIGHT

	Korben tries to control his car, reeling from the impact.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				You have just had an accident.
				Seven points have been temporarily
				removed...

	Korben manages to stop his cab, pulls over to the side.

						VOICE / KORBEN
				You have one point left on your license.
				Have a good day.

	Korben sighs and looks in the back seat to see what the damages are.  The
girl, a bit dazed (who wouldn&#39;t be), emerges from the debris and sits up.
There&#39;s some blood on her face.  Korben is stunned. The girl&#39;s still alive
and... so beautiful.  His heart heads for a meltdown.

						GIRL
				Akina delutan, nou-shan.

						KORBEN
					(lost)
				...&#39;Scuse me?

	A police car with wailing sirens halts in front of Korben.

						COP
					(over a loudspeaker)
				You have an unauthorized passenger in your
				vehicle.  We are going to arrest her.
				Please leave your hands on the wheel.
				Thank you for your cooperation.

						KORBEN
					(obeying)
				Sorry, Hon, but I only got one point left
				on my license and I gotta get to the garage!

	The police car presses up against the cab.  Doors slide open.  Huge guns
point at her.  Korben feels lousy.  The girl&#39;s helpless, there are tears in
her eyes, she looks exhausted.
	Korben glances at her in the rear view mirror. She&#39;s looking all around
to find something to help her communicate with him.

	Her POV: an ad on the back of the seat. An 800 number to help an
orphanage. A teary photo of a kid over the words Please Help.  She shoots
to Korben a look of pure distress.

						GIRL
					(irresistible)
				Please... HELP...

	Korben can&#39;t resist her plea.

						KORBEN
				Don&#39;t put me in this position...
				I can&#39;t... I&#39;m late as it is...

	But he cannot say no to her eyes.

						KORBEN
				Finger&#39;s gonna kill me.

	Korben shuts oft the meter and floors it, sideswiping the police car as
he roars away.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				Your license has been revoked.
				Would you please....

	Korben whips out a gun and shatters the loudspeaker.

						KORBEN
				I hate when people cry...
				I got no defense...

	The police car takes out after him, sirens screeching.  An insane chase
ensues.

59	INT.  NEW YORK  STREETS - DAY

	Korben and his flying taxi are absolute masters of the air.  The cops
have trouble following him but then another cop car comes to join in the
fun.  Korben drives like a man possessed, nothing can stop him. Except the
dead-end he&#39;s just come up against.

						GIRL
				Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!

						KORBEN
				It there&#39;s one thing I don&#39;t need advice on,
				it&#39;s how to drive.

	Korben turns his cab sideways and scrapes through a narrow passageway,
	ripping his taxi light from the roof.  The police car smashes into the
wall.  The other one brakes just in time.

						COP
				Shit! Attention all-patrol cars!

	The car makes a U-turn, looking for a wider passageway.

60	EXT.  NEW YORK  STREET

	The police car roars up, sirens screaming then slows down and checks out
a dead-end flanked by a large vertical neon billboard. The dead-end is empty .
Korben&#39;s cab is hidden vertically behind the billboard.  Seeing nothing, the
	police drive away.

						KORBEN
				We&#39;ll wait till things quiet down a bit.
				You mind?

	The girl grabs his shirt collar and pulls him close, whispers in his ear.

						GIRL
					(weak)
				...Priest...

						KORBEN
				You&#39;re not that bad... Come on we&#39;ll
				get you to a doctor.

	The girl hands him the handle of the case, struck with the three Egyptian
suns.

						GIRL
					(weak)
				Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...

						KORBEN
				Vito Cornelius?

	The girl nods, then faints.  Korben is somewhat lost faced with so much
mystery.

61	INT.  CORNELIUS&#39;  APARTMENT - DAY

	The door opens. Korben is there with the unconscious girl in his arms.

						KORBEN
					(embarrassed)
				Excuse me, I&#39;m looking for a priest.

						CORNELIUS
					(tired)
				Weddings are one floor down.
				Congratulations.

	Cornelius closes the door.  The doorbell RINGS again.

						KORBEN
				She&#39;s not my bride, she&#39;s my fare.
				She&#39;s looking for this Vito Cornelius.
				According to the phone guide he lives here.

						CORNELIUS
					(curious)
				That&#39;s me.  But I don&#39;t know who she is...
				where did you find her?

						KORBEN
				She dropped in on me... holding this.

	Korben hands him the metal handle with the three Egyptian suns, stamped
on it.

						CORNELIUS
					(staggered)
				The fifth element.

	He faints dead away.  Korben, with the girl still in his arms looks
around helpless.

						KORBEN
					(sighing)
				Finger&#39;s gonna kill me...

62	INT.  CORNELIUS&#39;  APARTMENT - DAY

	In his armchair, Cornelius gets woken by a slap in the face.

						CORNELIUS
					(with a start)
				Who are you?

						KORBEN
				I brought the girl remember?

						CORNELIUS
				The girl?

	Cornalius gets up.  He looks at the handle.

						KORBEN
				Yeah! She dropped in on me. I mean
				on my taxi... talking... this... this bizarre
				language...

	And then it dawns on Cornelius who the girl is.

						CORNELIUS
					(eyes riveted on her)
				He&#39;s a she!

						KORBEN
					(bemused)
				You noticed...

						CORNELIUS
					(face shining)
				There&#39;s not a moment to lose! Wake her up,
				but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind&#39;s
				most precious possession! She is... perfect!

						KORBEN
				So you do know her.

						CORNELIUS
				Uh yes, we&#39;re cousins..distant cousins..

	Cornelius runs into the next room.  Korben looks at the girl, goes to
slap her, then changes his mind.

	Her beauty troubles him.  He hesitates, then, gently caresses her cheek.
Her skin seems so soft, so fragile.

						KORBEN
				Perfect...

63	INT.  SMALL  ROOM

	David, is mending a cassock when Cornelius bursts into the room out of
breath.

						CORNELIUS
				It&#39;s a miracle!!!

						DAVID
					(worried)
				What is?

						CORNELIUS
					(babbling crazily)
				I can&#39;t wear these clothes! This calls
				for dignity!
				I have to dress the part!

	He opens a closet filled with identical robes and plunges in,
disappearing as David looks on, uncomprehending.

64	INT  LIVING ROOM.  CORNELIUS&#39;  APARTMENT

	Korben gently kisses the girl&#39;s cheeks, but she doesn&#39;t respond.  He
looks around then kisses her on the lips.  The girl&#39;s eyes snap open.
When Korben straightens up he discovers his own gun jammed under his
chin.

						GIRL
					(angry)
				Eto Akta Gamat!

						KORBEN
					(embarrassed)
				I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s just that... I was
				told to wake you up gently, so I figured...

	The girl pauses a moment.  She stares at him, looks puzzled.

						KORBEN
				You&#39;re right, I was wrong! I shouldn&#39;t
				have kissed you... especially since we
				haven&#39;t been introduced and...
					(he pulls out a business card)
				Here, it&#39;s a bit late, but... my name is
				Korben, Korben Dallas.
				Keep it, you never know, maybe... you&#39;ll
				need a cab one day.  I&#39;ll be happy to open
				the door this time!.

	The girl hesitates, then snatches the card like a wild animal.

65	INT.  SMALL  ROOM

	Cornelius is lost in the closet.

						DAVID
				Father, will you please explain what&#39;s
				going on?

						CORNELIUS
				The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here,
				in our parish!!! It&#39;s a miracle!!!

66	INT.  LIVING ROOM

						KORBEN
				...What&#39;s your name?

					(after a moment)
				Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai
				Ekbat De Sebat.

						KORBEN
					(polite)
				Hey,  that&#39;s... cute... Do you have a nickname,
				something a little... shorter?

						GIRL
				...Leeloo.

	Korben is falling in love.

						KORBEN
				That&#39;s... really cute...

	Cornelius bursts into the room.  She turns the gun on him.
	He bows before her.

						CORNELIUS
				Appipulai Leeloo Minai..

						LEELOO
				Corn-i-Lius?

						CORNELIUS
					(bowing)
				At your service.

	LEELOO lowers her guard starts to laugh.  An irresistible childish laugh.
	Korben smiles.

						DAVID
				Father.  You sure she&#39;s the Supreme Being?

						CORNELIUS
				Absolutely sure There&#39;s the triple suns on
				her gloves!

	David bows low, but his eyes glance up at Leeloo.  Cornelius begins to
lead Korben toward the door, hustling him out.

						KORBEN
				They all like this in your family, father?

						CORNELIUS
				She&#39;s an exception..

						CORNELIUS
				Thank you so much for your help Mr...?

						KORBEN
				Dallas. Korben Dallas.

	Cornelius takes his arm. Leeloo stops laughing when she sees Korben
leaving.

						CORNELIUS
				Yes. That&#39;s fine! Thank you very much.
				A thousand times over!

						KORBEN
				I might call to check up on her,
				you know... to see if she&#39;s better?

						CORNELIUS
				She&#39;s fine, really..don&#39;t you worry..
				just needs some rest..she&#39;s had a very long trip.

						KORBEN
				I know. I was there when she arrived.

	Cornelius is about to close the door.  Korben&#39;s hand blocks it.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something
				to me a while ago and... I don&#39;t really get it...
				Akta Gamat?

						CORNELIUS
				It means, &quot;Never without my permission&quot;.

						KORBEN
				That&#39;s what I thought.

	Cornelius slams the door in his face.

						KORBEN
				...Thanks.

66A	INT.  KORBEN&#39;S  APARTMENT - DAY

	Korben beads down the hallway. He passes his NEIGHBOR.

	Korben enters his-apartment.

66B	INT.. KORBEN&#39;S  APARTMENT - DAY

	The door slides back and the cat comes rubbing up against him, tail in
the air.

						KORBEN
				Oh god. I forgot your food ... I&#39;m really sorry!
				How about a nice Thai nosh to apologize?
				How does that sound, huh?

	The cat meows, appeased, just an the phone rings.

				So, just how big was this fare?

						KORBEN

	Leeloo has a towel wrapped around her, it looks like she just took a
shower.  She sits  in front of a computer wolfing down some chicken.  Data
scrolls by on the screen.  David watches from the corner, in awe.

						DAVID
				What&#39;s she doing?

						CORNELIUS
				Learning our history!
				The last 5000 years that she missed!
				She&#39;s been out of circulation a while,
				you know.

	Leeloo breaks into her childish laughter.

						CORNELIUS
				What&#39;re you laughing about?

						LEELOO
					(pronouncing badly)
				Napoleon... small.

	She laughs again and tosses some capsules into the microwave.

						DAVID
					(hesitant)
				Uh father, I know she&#39;s been through a lot...
				but the sacred stones..we don&#39;t have much
				time..

						CORNELIUS
				Yes. Of course..

	Leeloo takes her plate out of the microwave.  A steaming plate heaped
with chicken and exotic vegetables.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo..I&#39;m sorry to interrupt you but..

	She sits back down in front of the screen and chomps away heavily on her
second chicken.  Cornelius sits opposite her. and holds up the case
handle.

						CORNELIUS
					(serious)
				The case..with the stones...
				Where is it?

						LEELOO
				San Agamat chay bet... envolet!

						CORNELIUS
				The case was stolen?

	Leeloo nods her head, quite unperturbed and continues to devour the food
in front of her.

						CORNELIUS
					(shocked)
				Who in gods name would do such

69	INT.  CORRIDOR.  ZORG&#39;S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	CLOSE ON: A pair of feet limping heavily.  A MAN comes alongside them.

						RIGHT ARM
				Excuse me sir, the council is worried about
				the economy heating up.  They wondered if
				it would be possible to fire 500...

	They reach a door at the end of the corridor.  Zorg enters a code.

						ZORG
				Fire 1000.

						RIGHT ARM
				But... 500 is all they need, sir.

	ZORG turns slowly.  A small scar across run across his face, his eye
stutters.
	This is not a man to cross, or contradict.

						RIGHT ARM
				1000! Fine, sir!
				Sorry to have disturbed you.

	The door opens...

	... and David enters carrying a bundle of clothes.

						CORNELIUS
				There was this guy with a limp who
				came a month ago..said he was an art

				the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn&#39;t think
				anything of it.. What was his name? I&#39;m so
				bad with names...

						DAVID
					(to Leeloo, timid)
				I didn&#39;t know your size.

	Leeloo is happy. She pulls off the towel and stands there nude. Cornelius
and David turn away.

						DAVID
				They really made her...

						CORNELIUS
				Perfect.

	Leeloo finishes dressing. She is delighted.

						LEELOO
					(to David)
				Domo danko!

	David smiles, dumb with admiration.  Cornelius comes over.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo?  The Stones...
				We must get them back.

	Leeloo settles down, sits at the computer and turns it on.

						LEELOO
				Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!

						CORNELIUS
				You know exactly where they are!

71	INT.  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	A group of handsome WARRIORS approaches.  AKNOT, their leader has the
sacred case in his hands.  The metal handle is missing but the second
metal glove is still grasping the case.

						ZORG
					(pretending to be worried)
				Aknot?  Is that you?

	The LEADER nods. A disgusted look stamps Zorg&#39;s features.

						ZORG
				...What an ugly face! Doesn&#39;t suit you at all!
				Take it off...

	AKNOT&#39;s face burns away revealing the head of a monstrous MANGALORE.

						ZORG
				That&#39;s better! Never be ashamed of
				who you are...
				You&#39;re warriors... be proud...

	AKNOT says nothing, but if his eyes could talk!

						ZORG
				So what if the Federal Army crushed your
				entire race and scattered your people to the
				wind...
				Your time for revenge is at hand...
				Voila... the ZF1.

	He takes out a weapon from one a crate and goes into a sales pitch.

						ZORG
					(very fast)
				...It&#39;s light... the handle&#39;s adjustable for
				easy carrying... good for righties and lefties.

	Meanwhile, two MEN set up a mannequin rigged with various defense
mechanisms at the far end of the warehouse.

						ZORG
				... Breaks down into four parts, undetectable by
				X-rays.. It&#39;s the ideal weapon for quick, discreet
				interventions.  A word on fire power: Titanium
				recharger. 3000 round clip with bursts of 3 to 300.
				With the replay button, another Zorg innovation,
				it&#39;s even easier... one shot.

	He fires at the mannequin.

						ZORG
				... and replay sends every following shot
				to the same location...

	Zorg spins around, the rounds all hit the mannequin.

						ZORG
					(even faster)
				I recharge, but the enemy has launched a
				cowardly sneak attack from behind, the
				automirror takes care of that.  Gives me the
				time to turn around and finish the job.
				300 round bursts, then there are the Zorg oldies...

	He fires off each item he names.

						ZORG
				...Rocket launcher.  The always efficient
				flame thrower... My favorite.
				Our famous net launcher, the arrow launcher,
				with exploding or poisonous gas heads - very
				practical.
				And for the grand finale, the all-new ice-cube
				system!

	The mannequin has been blasted into a pile of ashes covered by a net,.
stuck with arrows, the whole mess frozen solid. He tosses the weapon into
AKNOT&#39;s hands.

						ZORG
				...Four full crates, delivered right on time!
				What about you, my dear Aknot, did
				you bring me what I asked you for?

	AKNOT sets the case on a crate.  Zorg gloats while stroking the case.

						ZORG
				...Magnificent.

	Zorg smiles, takes a deep breath, opens the case.  It&#39;s empty

72	INT.  CORNELIUS&#39;  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo breaks into her childish laughter once again.

						CORNELIUS
					(astonished)
				What do you mean empty?

73	INT.  ZORG&#39;S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	AKNOT looks into the case.  Things grow tense.

						ZORG
				Alright..I&#39;ve got an open mind here..
				anyone care to explain?

74	INT.  CORNELIUS&#39;  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo explains what happened in her language.

						CORNELIUS
					(translating)
				She says that the Guardians never really had
				much faith in humans. They were afraid of
				being attacked. The stones were given to someone
				they could trust who took another route.
				She&#39;s supposed to contact this person in a little less
				than twelve hours from now in a hotel.
				She&#39;s looking for the address!

	A map of the stars flashes onto the screen, Leeloo points.

						LEELOO
				Dot!

	The little group comes over to look.

						DAVID
				Planet Fhloston, in the Angel constellation

	Cornelius plops down into his armchair.

						CORNELIUS
				...We&#39;re saved!

75	INT.  ZORG&#39;S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

						ZORG
				I&#39;m fucked!

	Zorg calmly closes the case and gives Aknot a blood-chilling stare.

						AKNOT
				You asked for a case.
				We brought you a case.

						ZORG
					(shouting)
				A case with four stones in it. Not one!
				Not two or three! But four!!! Four stones!!!
				What the fuck am I supposed to do with an
				EMPTY case?!!

AKNOT&#39;s men grow edgy.

						AKNOT
					(tense)
				...We are warriors, not merchants!

						ZORG
					(humored)
				But you can still count.  Look...
				my fingers.

	He holds up four fingers.

						ZORG
				...Four stones, four crates... Zero stones...
					(yelling)
				ZERO CRATES!!!
					(to his men)
				Put everything back, we&#39;re outta here.

	AKNOT&#39;s warriors turn their weapons on Zorg.

						AKNOT
					(icily)
				We risked our lives. I believe a
				little compensation is in order.

						ZORG
					(smiling)
				So, you are a merchant, after all.
					(to his men)
				Leave them one crate.  For the cause!

	Zorg&#39;s men leave a crate and exit with the other three.

76	EXT.  OUTSIDE  ZORG&#39;S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	Zorg walks along the street to his limo.  RIGHT ARM carries the empty
case.

						ZORG
				I don&#39;t like warriors!  They&#39;re too
				narrow-minded, no sublety.  Worse,
				they fight for hopeless causes..for honor!
				Honor has killed millions of people but
				hasn&#39;t saved a single one.
					(pause)
				You know what -- do I like though, I like killer.
				  A real dyed in the wool killer.  Cold-blooded.
				Clean.  Methodical.  Thorough.  A killer, when
				he picked up the ZF1, would&#39;ve immediately
				asked about the little red button on the bottom of
				the gun.

77	INT.  HALLWAY  ZORG&#39;S WAREHOUSE - DAY

				So you forgive me?

	The cat meows just as a red light blinks, announcing the arrival of a
message in a glass tube.  Korben ignores it.

						THAI
				Not going to open?

						KORBEN
				I&#39;ve never gotten a message that wasn&#39;t
				bad news.

						THAI
				How someone strong like you scared from
				a message? Is good news I sure!

						KORBEN
				The last two messages I got?  The first one
				was from my wife telling me she was leaving!
				And the second was from my lawyer telling me
				he was leaving too... with my wife.

						THAI
				You right that is bad.. but mathematically
				luck must change!
				Grandfather say: &quot;It never rain every day.&quot;
				This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!

	Korben hesitates, then gives the envelope to the Thai, who opens it with
a big smile that fades as reads the contents aloud.

						THAI
				...You&#39;re fired. Oh!

	Korben smiles at him.

						KORBEN
				At least I won lunch.

						THAI
				Good philosophy..see good in bad..

						CORNELIUS
				Good work, my son.  Now all we need is

						ZORG
				Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg...
				nice to see you again

						CORNELIUS
				I remember you now..the so called
				art dealer.

						ZORG
				I&#39;m glad you got your memory back, Father...
				Because you&#39;re going to need it...
				Where are the stones?

						CORNELIUS
				...Why on earth do the stones interest you?

						ZORG
				Personally, they are of no interest to me,
				I&#39;d rather sell weapons..but I have a customer...
				so tell me...

						CORNELIUS
				Even it I did know where the stones were
				I would never tell somebody like you.

						ZORG
				Why?  What&#39;s wrong with me?

						CORNELIUS
				...I&#39;m a priest! I&#39;m here to serve life,
				All you want to do is destroy it.

						ZORG
				Ah, Father... You are so wrong.
				Let me explain...

	Zorg leads Cornelius into his inner office.

						ZORG
				...would you like a drink?

						CORNELIUS
				No thank you.

						ZORG
				Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve,
				comes from destruction. Look at this empty
				glass.

	Zorg pushes the glass with his finger.

						ZORG
				Here it is... peaceful... serene...
				but if it is...

	Zorg pushes the glass off the table.  It shatters on the floor.

						ZORG
				Destroyed...

	Small individual robots, both free-wheeling and integrated, come zipping
out to clean up the mess.

						ZORG
				...Look at all these little things...
				so busy all of a sudden.
				Notice how each one is useful.
				What a lovely ballet, so full of form
				and color.  So full of..life!

						CORNELIUS
				They are robots!

	A SERVANT comes in pours water in another glass.  Zorg tosses a cherry
into it.

						ZORG
				Yes but... by that simple gesture of destruction.
				I gave work to at least fifty people today. The
				engineers, the technicians, the mechanics. Fifty
				people who will be able to feed their children so
				they can grow up big and strong.  Children who
				will have children of their own, adding to the great
				cycle of life!

	Cornelius sits in silence.

						ZORG
				Father, by creating a little destruction,
				I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in
				reality, you and I are in the same business!

						CORNELIUS
				Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people
				with the weapons you produce is quite another.

						ZORG
				Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill
				more people in my entire life than religion has
				killed in the last 2000 years.

	Zorg smiles, holds up the glass and takes a drink.
	Unfortunately, he chokes on the cherry.  Unable to breathe, Zorg starts
to panic.

						CORNELIUS
					(mocking)
				Where&#39;s the robot to pat your back?

	Zorg falls, writhing, on his desk, inadvertently hitting buttons which
trigger a slew of little mechanisms.  They pop out all over the desk.
True chaos reigns.  Even a cage appears, holding a Souliman Aktapan, a fat
multicolored beastie, PICASSO, who seems surprised to be out in daylight.  He
licks his half-dead master in thanks.  Cornelius gets up and walks around
the desk.  Zorg motions for help.

						CORNELIUS
				Can I give you a hand?

	Cornelius whacks him on the back.  The cherry comes flying out.  Zorg
regains control of himself. GUARDS come running in.

						ZORG
				You saved my life... So, I&#39;m going
				to spare yours.
					(to the GUARDS)
				Throw him out!

	The GUARDS throw Cornelius out.

						CORNELIUS
				You are a monster, Zorg!

						ZORG
					(complimented)
				I know...

	The GUARDS drag Cornelius out of the office.

						ZORG
				...Torture whoever you want, the
				president if you have to but I want
				those Stones. You have an hour.

	Right Arm salutes and hurries out of the office.

	Korben forces a weak, polite smile as the Thai looks on expectantly.  The
phone rings.

						KORBEN
				Saved by the bell.

	Korben rises to get his cigarettes, and answer the phone.

						KORBEN
				...Hello?

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				You&#39;re the nastiest dirtbag I know in

						KORBEN
					(resigned)
				Hi Ma...

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				I&#39;ve been playing twice a week for 20 years,
				20 years I&#39;ve been eating those shitty croquettes.

	Korben goes to light his cigarette.  There are only two matches left in
the match box.
	Korben strikes one and it fizzles.

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				You wouldn&#39;t even eat one to help your
				poor mother, and you win the big prize?
				Know something? The whole thing makes
				me sick!

	The Thai starts to clean up.  Just as Korben goes to strike the second
match..

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				Are you listening to me, you ingrate!

						KORBEN
					(resigned)
				Yes ma..

	Korben sighs and puts the match back in the box.

	Korben enters his code on the keypad the Thai is holding.

						KORBEN
					(to the Thai)
				Go on... This is gonna take a while!

The Thai casts oft.  Korben closes the window.

						KORBEN
				Other than that... You all right?

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				...And now you&#39;re making fun of me?
				I&#39;m warning you! If you don&#39;t take me
				after all these years of sacrifice, I&#39;ll
				never forgive you!!

	The Thai flies off.  In the hall, the cat meows-for more food.

						KORBEN
					(to the cat)
				I&#39;m coming!. Ma, what&#39;re you talking
				about?

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				I get it! You want to make me beg,
				is that it?

						KORBEN
				All I want is an explanation! I just got
				in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab.
				I got mugged, but other than that
				everything&#39;s peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!!
				Now settle down and explain to me calmly..

	A message drops in his tube.  The red light goes on.

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				You just won a trip, you dolt!
				Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!

						KORBEN
				Ma. If I&#39;d won, I&#39;d know about it.

	He eyeballs the message still in the tube.  The doorbell rings.-

						KORBEN
				Ma.. it&#39;s the door. I&#39;ll call you back.

	Korben hangs up before his mother can say anything and heads for the
door.  Before he gets there it opens, General Munro enters followed by a
Captain and a Major.
	MAJOR ICEBORG is a woman. All she needs to become a man is a mustache.
	Munro opens a file.

						MUNRO
					(clipped)
				Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct
				you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal
				Army on your enlistment which is more than
				you will need for a mission of the utmost
				importance.

						KORBEN
				What mission?

						MUNRO
				To save the world.

						KORBEN
				Where have I heard this song before?

						MUNRO
				You&#39;re to leave immediately for Fhloston
				Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the
				Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with
				the utmost discretion as possible.
				Any questions&#39;?

						KORBEN
					(a little bewildered)
				Just one... why me?

						MUNRO
				Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite
				Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army
				you are an expert in the use of all weapons
				and spacecraft needed for this mission.

	Munro pulls out a long list of documents.

						MUNRO
				Two: Of all the members of your unit
				you were the most highly decorated.

						KORBEN
				And the third one?

						MUNRO
				You&#39;re the only one left alive...

	Munro removes the message Korben hasn&#39;t bothered to look at.

						MUNRO
				Don&#39;t you open your messages?

						KORBEN
				I&#39;ve had enough good news for today

						MUNRO
					(by rote)
				You have won the annual Gemini contest
				and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two.
				Congratulations.
				Here are your tickets.

	He hands Korben the tickets.  Korben gets it.

						KORBEN
				You rigged the contest?

	Munro nods.

						MUNRO
				Major Iceborg will accompany you...
				as your wife...

	The idea of taking a trip with Iceborg makes him sick.

						KORBEN
					(sarcastic)
				You couldn&#39;t come up with something
				a little more discreet?

						MUNRO
				Old tricks are the best tricks eh?

						KORBEN
				I&#39;m not going.

						MUNRO
				Why not?

						KORBEN
				One reason... I want to stay the only
				one left alive.

				What is it?

	Korben has two seconds to make up something to get rid of Munro.

						KORBEN
				It&#39;s my wife.

						MUNRO
				I thought you were divorced.

						KORBEN
				I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex..
				if she sees you here I&#39;m finished.  She hates
				you guys. It&#39;s what killed us in the first place.
				Please...

	He puts them in the fridge, shoving the jellyfish cake in Iceborg&#39;s
hands.

						KORBEN
				...Sorry, General, but we&#39;ve got no choice!
				It&#39;ll only take a minute! Let me set up
				another meeting and I&#39;ll be back.

						MUNRO
				Three of us will never fit in there!

						KORBEN
					(pushing him)
				Oh, yes you will...

	Korben slams the fridge door.  The doorbell RINGS again.

						KORBEN
				...Coming!

	He whips through his place in ten seconds, gathers up things laying

	shuts drawers, rolls up his laundry in the folding bed. He brushes his
hair back

	eyes held by Cornelius.

						LEELOO
				Apipoulai!

						KORBEN
				I suppose that means &quot;Hi&quot; ?

						CORNELIUS
				I&#39;m sorry to have to resort to such
				methods, but we heard about your
				good luck on he radio and we need
				the tickets to Fhloston.

						KORBEN
				Is that the usual way priests go on
				vacation?

						CORNELIUS
				We&#39;re not going on vacation..we&#39;re
				on a mission..

						KORBEN
				What kind of mission?

						CORNELIUS
					(sincere)
				We have to save the world.

						KORBEN
					(skeptical)
				Good luck..

						CORNELIUS
				Of course.

						KORBEN
				Father, I was in the Army for awhile
				and every time they told us we were
				on a mission to save the world the
				only thing that changed was I lost a
				lot of friends. So thanks for the offer..
				but no thanks.

	Cornelius is disappointed.  Leeloo looks crestfallen.

						KORBEN
				I&#39;m sorry..

						VOICE
				This is a police control action..

	Everyone freezes as the whole building resounds with the electronic
voice.

111	INT.  LANDING  KORBEN&#39;S  BUILDING

	A group of POLICEMEN bursts into the hallway.  One of the cops enters a
code on the police wall box.  A device descends from the ceiling, a
flashing light-siren,
	a VOICE fills the air.

						VOICE
				This is not an exercise.
				This is a police control.

	Cornelius starts to panic.  Korben takes charge.

						CORNELIUS
				Oh my god oh my god..

	Korben pushes a button sending the fridge to the next floor.  A shower
takes it&#39;s place.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo, hide in here and don&#39;t move!

	Leeloo hops in.  Korben tosses Cornelius on the bed.

						CORNELIUS
				What are you doing?

						KORBEN
				Trying to save your ass so you can
				save the world.

	..and hits a button on the wall.  The bed disappears into the wall.

	Korben grabs his tickets and slides them in his belt.

112	INT.  LANDING  KORBEN&#39;S  BUILDING - DAY

	Meanwhile, the automatic police voice continues.

						VOICE
				...Spread your legs and place your
				hands in the yellow circles, please.

	A COP slaps a viewer device on Korben&#39;s door which makes part of it
transparent.

						COP 1
				Put your hands in the yellow circles,
				please.

	Korben takes his time hiding his face. The Cop looks at his sheet. He&#39;s
looking for
	a... KORBEN DALLAS. He has his picture, but it is Korben with long hair
and beard.

						COP 1
					(to COP 2)
				Sir? Are you a human?

						KORBEN
				No, I&#39;m a meat popsicle.

						COP 3
					(at the other end of the hall)
				I found him!

	C.U. Korben&#39;s calling card is clumsily stuck to the door of the
neighbor&#39;s apartment.  COP 3 slaps the viewer on the nasty neighbor&#39;s door.
The neighbor is at his sink shaving instead of against the wall, COP 1
arrives with Korben&#39;s picture.

						COP 1
				Sir, this is a control.  Please put your
				hands in the yellow circles.

	The neighbor steps right up to the viewer, shaving cream on his face.  He
could pass for Korben.

						NEIGHBOR
				Fuck you!!

113	INT.  KORBEN&#39;S  APARTMENT

	Korben still has his hands to the wall.

						KORBEN
				Wrong answer.

	SHOT O.S. EXPLOSION.  Scuffle.

114	INT.  HALL

	The riot police hustle down the hall dragging the neighbor behind them in
a canvas bag.  A cop is on the wall phone.

						COP
				OK, we got the guy under wraps.

115	INT.  ZORG&#39;S  OFFICE

	Right Arm is on the phone, facing Zorg.

						COP (O.S.)
				It was not easy, but we bagged him!.
				Thanks for the tip!

						RIGHT ARM
					(smiling)
				Glad to help.

	He hangs up.

						RIGHT ARM
				They just arrested the guy for Uranium
				smuggling. Everything&#39;s going as planned.

	He shows him a plane ticket, and a passport with his picture and Korben&#39;s
name.

						RIGHT ARM
				All I have to do now is to go to the
				airport and take his place.  I should be
				in Fhloston in less than four hours.

	Zorg sits there quietly for a moment.

						ZORG
				Don&#39;t come back without the Stones.

116	INT.  KORBEN&#39;S  APARTMENT

	Korben opens the shower door.  Leeloo is soaking wet, her teeth
chattering from the cold.

						KORBEN
				I&#39;m really sorry.. there wasn&#39;t time.

His eyes fall on an old blanket.

						KORBEN
				Here let me wrap you up.

	Korben wraps her in an blanket and vigoroualy rubs her back.  Leeloo
warms gradually and snuggles closer to that warm comfortable shoulder.
Korben&#39;s rubbing slows, looking more like caresses.

						KORBEN
			..It&#39;s funny.  I&#39;ve met you twice today  and
			you&#39;ve ended up in my arms both times.

	Leeloo suddenly realizes that she has maybe gone a bit too far.
	She recovers, looking embarrassed too.

						LEELOO
					(nicely)
				Valo massa... Chacha hamas.

						KORBEN
				Uh..you&#39;re welcome.

	The intimacy makes him nervous.  He looks for a diversion.

						KORBEN
				Coffee!  That&#39;s what you need!
				A nice, hot cup of coffee!

	He pushes a button on the coffee machine.

						KORBEN
				With some honey!  You&#39;ll see, honey&#39;s
				great!...

	Korben rummages through the drawer.  Leeloo, innocent, doesn&#39;t seem to
quite understand everything that is going on.

						KORBEN
				A hot cup of coffee... with honey...

	He rummages through the cupboard, exceedingly nervous.  Leeloo smiles and
begins to look around.  She opens a drawer and comes upon..

						KORBEN
					(nervously)
				I&#39;ve got this great honey somewhere.
				You know about honey?  There used to be
				these little animals who made it with antenna...

	..pictures of Major Korben Dallas War Hero.

						KORBEN
				..and these other animals who ate it..
				one were bees the other were bears..

	She looks back to the man fumbling for honey.

						KORBEN
				I forget which ate it and which made it
				but..

	And she smiles.

						KORBEN
				Here it is!

	Korben holds up the jar of honey.

						KORBEN
				Taste this...

	Leeloo innocently sticks his finger in the jar then puts it in her mouth.

						KORBEN
				It... melts in your mouth, doesn&#39;t it?

	She savors the honey, slowly; sensually.  Her lips shine with honey.  Her
eyes narrow with pleasure.  Korben is hypnotized by her lips, like a moth
attracted to a flame.  He begins to lose control, which makes him nervous.

	An indistinct sound comes from the wall.  But Korben is so entranced with
the sight of Leeloo licking her honied fingers, he doesn&#39;t hear it until
it becomes quite a racket.

						KORBEN
				You hear that?

						LEELOO
					(licking)
				Cornelius..

						KORBEN
				Oh god!

	Korben pushes the button on the wall.  The bed pops out, fully made, with
Cornelius tucked in it, struggling to get out.

						KORBEN
				I&#39;m really sorry.. let me help you..

Korben begins to pull at the covers when..

						LEELOO
				Achta ge lumitai de matala..

	Korben turns..

						KORBEN
				What?

	He turns to Leeloo struggling out of her wet clothes. His breath is taken
away by the sight of her perfect body.

	Cornelius whacks him heavily on the head with a lamp.  Korben drops to
the floor.

						LEELOO
					(displeased)
				Vano da, mechteba?!
				Soun domo kala chon hammas!

						CORNELIUS
				No, I&#39;m not proud of myself...
				But we don&#39;t have the luxury of choice.

117	INT.  ENTRANCE  KORBEN&#39;S  BUILDING - DAY

	The POLICE exit the elevator and head for the front door.  A cop suddenly
takes a hit from a silencer, then a second. Others are bashed on the head
by MANGALORE warriors.  One of them picks up the prisoner bag, takes it
into a small shed.

118	INT.  SHED

	Aknot, the Mangalore leader, is seriously wounded and can&#39;t walk.

						AKANIT
				Korben Dallas!  We got him.

						AKNOT
				Perfect... Take command, Akanit.
				Go to Fhloston and get the Stones...
				If Zorg really wants them... He&#39;ll have
				to negotiate.  Revenge is at hand.

119	INT.  KORBEN&#39;S APARTMENT  KORBEN&#39;S  BUILDING - DAY

	Korben gets unsteadily to his feet, some blood drips down his face. He
daubs at it.

						KORBEN
				Jesus!... Some priest!

	The phone rings, he manages to answer.

						KORBEN
				Yeah?

						MOTHER (V.O)
				Have you pulled yourself together?

						KORBEN
				...Not yet.

	He hangs up.

	Korben opens the fridge door.  The three officers are frozen solid.
Korben grabs some ice, presses it to his forehead.

						KORBEN
				I&#39;ll take the mission.

	He closes the door.

120	INT. AIRPORT  HALL - DAY

	Cornelius and Leeloo (still damp) arrive at the Manhattan Intergalactic
Airport.
	A huge hall three quarters filled with trash piled up to the ceiling.

	There are groups of extra-terrestrials on strike standing in trash
holding picket signs.  A SECURITY GUARD picks up a phone off the wall.

						SECURITY GUARD
				Illegal gathering in Zone 4.

	A hand taps Leeloo from behind.  She whips around catching David in the
face.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo, be careful.

	He turns to David who in holding his bloody nose.

						CORNELIUS
				Did you get them?

	David hands Cornelius two passports.

						CORNELIUS
				Excellent... Leeloo Dallas.

	He hands it to her.  The name makes her smile.

						CORNELIUS
				And Korben David Dallas.

	She frowns.

						LEELOO
				Akta dedero ansila do mektet.

						CORNELIUS
				I can&#39;t pretend to be your husband...
				David&#39;s in great shape.

	She looks at David holding his bloody nose.

						CORNELIUS
				He&#39;ll protect you. Go on... See the Diva...
				get the Stones... See you at the temple...
				God be with you.

	ANGLE ON: Korben comes rushing into the airport. Walking quickly, he
scopes the hall looking for Leeloo. A POLICE PATROL bearing down on the
STRIKERS jostles him. The cops open fire.  The strikers dive into the garbage
and disappear.

121	INT.  BOARDING  GATE

	David nervously puts tickets and IDs on the check-in counter.
	Leeloo tosses her suitcase on the conveyor belt.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
				Congratulations on winning the contest.

	David gives her a bleak smile.  Leeloo rolls her eyes.

	Back a ways, Korben has spotted Leeloo and... David.  He heads right for
them.  Leeloo&#39;s seen him. She is both delighted and panicked.  David&#39;s
seen nothing.  Korben presses one of his fingers like a gun to David&#39;s back.

						KORBEN
					(friendly)
				Hey! I really thought I was going to
				miss my flight!
					(to David)
				Thanks, kid! You put the luggage on
				the conveyor belt?

						DAVID
					(freaking)
				Uh... yeah.

						KORBEN
					(smiling)
				Great! Now beat it!

	Paralyzed, David leaves.  Korben turns to the attendant.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me.  I was so afraid I&#39;d miss the
				flight that I sent the kid here to pick up
				my boarding card.

	He looks at David&#39;s fake ID.

						KORBEN
				...My cousin David...

	Leeloo is unable to hold back a smile.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(looking at Leeloo&#39;s ID)
				Your wife?

	Korben grabs the ID and reads it.

						KORBEN
				Uh, yes... Newlyweds.
					(aside)
				You know how it is... Love at first sight.
				You meet, something goes tilt,. you get
				married, you hardly know each other.
				Right, darling?

	Leeloo rips her boarding card out of the attendant&#39;s hand.

						LEELOO
					(sharply)
				Dinoine chagantakat!

						KORBEN
				Took the words right out of my mouth.
				Go on... I&#39;ll be right with you.
					(to Check-in Attendant)
				It&#39;s our honeymoon. We&#39;re going to use
				the trip to get to know each other better.

	He winks at the stewardess.

	ANGLE ON:

	The neighbor and a tawdry young girl cross the airport.  The couple in
almost knocked over by a police patrol holding a 500 pound PIG on a
stainless steel leash. The couple panics a moment, the realize the patrol
isn&#39;t for them. The pig heads for the pile where the strikers disappeared.

						COP
					(to pig)

				Come on, snyffer, go root!

	The pig piles into the garbage.  The Cop cuts it some slack.
	Cornelius sits at a bar.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the bartender)
				I feel so guilty sending her to do the dirty
				work. I know she was made to be strong
				but she&#39;s also so fragile... So human.
				You know what I mean?

	The bartender, a robot, nods his head as he pours Cornelius a drink.

	ANGLE ON:

	The nasty neighbor and his wife hand their tickets to the check-in
attendant.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(surprised)
				Dallas... Korben...

						NEIGHBOR
					(in a different voice)
				Yes, that&#39;s me.

	The check-in attendant triggers a transparent blue light that shines on
their faces, revealing two other faces:

	Mangalores.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(smiling)
				Just a minute, please.

	She hits a silent alarm, but the Mangalores feel something is wrong.

						NEIGHBOR
				We&#39;ll be right back ... we&#39;re gonna
				check out the duty free...

	They spin around and hurry away.

	ANGLE ON:

	Cornelius at the bar, half in the bag.

						ROBOT
				The same?

						CORNELIUS
				Yeah...

						DAVID (V.O.)
				Make that two...

	Cornelius turns to David.

						CORNELIUS
				Where&#39;s Leeloo?

						DAVID
				On the plane... with Mr. Dallas...
				the real one.

						CORNELIUS
				It&#39;s all my fault.  I&#39;m the servant...
				It&#39;s my mission! Here!

	He hands David the Temple Key from around his neck.

						CORNELIUS
				Here&#39;s the key to the Temple..
				Prepare for our arrival!

	Cornelius tosses David&#39;s drink into his own, downs it all in one shot,
and takes off, passing the Mangalore couple headed for the exit.  They are
very nervous.
	A police patrol is coming.  This time, it seems to be for them.

						NEIGHBOR
					(to the tawdry girl)
				Tell Aknot plan A flopped.
				Tell him to go to plan B.

	The tawdry girl nods and peels off. The neighbor takes out a gun and
blasts away at the cops.  The cops fire back. A firefight rages in the
hall. The tawdry girl dives into a pile of garbage and disappears.

						COP
					(into walkie-talkie)
				...Send in a back-up unit, Zone 7!

	ANGLE ON:

	On one side of the hall, a trap door opens. Three pigs come running out,
grabbed by their police handler.

	Cornelius waits until everyone has left, gets down on all fours and
crawls through the trapdoor reserved for the pigs.

122	INT.  FIRST  CLASS  LOUNGE

	Leeloo stands at the buffet in the first class lounge eating everything
in sight.

123	INT.  HALL

	Korben is led down the hall by a STEWARDESS.

						STEWARDESS
				You are so lucky... Loc Rhod is the
				coolest DJ in the universe.

						KORBEN
				Listen... I don&#39;t want to be interviewed.
				I&#39;d prefer to remain anonymous.

	The stewardess stops in the corridor.

						STEWARDESS
				Forget anonymous.  You&#39;ll be doing Loc
				Rhod&#39;s live show every day from 5 to 7!

						KORBEN
					(expression changes)
				You gotta be kidding!

	The stewardess smiles and shakes her head.  The door next to him suddenly
swings open and smashes him in the face.

	In walks LOC RHOD amidst a tornado of music and security guards.  He is
young, good-looking, eccentric, charming as an elf or sly as a fox.  A
bundle of energy.  He is the 24th century&#39;s most popular DJ.

						LOC RHOD
					(speedy, in rhythm)
				Korben Dallas! Here he is The most hated
				man in the universe. The one and only winner
				of the Gemini Croquette contest! Ladies, start
				melting &#39;cause the boy&#39;s hot! Hot! Hot! The boy
				is perfect..
					(he feels his muscles)
				...The right size, right build, right hair.  Right on!
				Say something-to those 50 billion pair of ears out
				there D-man!

	An ASSISTANT hands a totally lost Korben a mike.

						KORBEN
					(hesitant)
				...Hi.

						LOC RHOD
				Does it get any better or what!

	Loc Rhod grabs Korben&#39;s arm and leads him down the hallway, as fast as
the music.

						LOC RHOD
				...Quiver ladies, he&#39;s gonna set the world on
				fire right here from 5 to 7! You&#39;ll know
				everything there is to know about the D-man.
				His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of
				intimates.  And from what I&#39;m looking at
				intimate is the stud muffin&#39;s middle name.
				So tell me my main man... you nervous in the
				service?

						KORBEN
				Uh... not really.

	Loc Rhod lets go of Korben&#39;s arm and grabs the Stewardess.

						LOC RHOD
				Freeze those knees, my chickadees, &#39;cause
				Korben is on the case with a major face...

	Loc Rhod rubs up against the stewardess.

						LOC RHOD
				...Start drooling, ladies! My man here is a
				sharp-tongued Sire who&#39;s gonna stroke your
				every desire.

	They come to an intersection.  The airline company has prepared drinks
for them.  Loc Rhod pushes on, grabs a glass of champagne, scribbles his
autograph.

						LOC RHOD
				Yesterday&#39;s unknown will be tomorrow&#39;s Prince
				of Fhloston Paradise, the hotel of a thousand and
				one follies, home of luxury and beauty.  A magic
				fountain flowing with non-stop wine, women and
				Bootchie Koochie Koo...

	He tosses away his champagne glass.

						LOC RHOD
				Beware out there puppy dogs my man is on
				the prowl. Owwww!

	Howling, Loc Rhod grabs another stewardess by the arm.

						LOC RHOD
				...And start licking your stamps little girls,
				this guy&#39;s gonna have you writing home to
				Momma! Tomorrow from 5 to 7, I&#39;ll be your
				voice, your tongue and I&#39;ll be hot on the tail
				of the sexiest man of the year... D-man...
				Your man... My man.

	The stewardess shivers.  A BEEP is heard.

						VOCODER (O.S.)
				End of transmission.

	The MUSIC suddenly stops.  Several assistants come and compliment Loc
Rhod who sighs, lights up a cigarette, and drops his pretense.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben sweetheart do me a favor I know this
				is probably the biggest thing that ever happened
				to you in your inconsequential life. But I&#39;ve got
				a show to do here and it&#39;s got to pop. So tomorrow,
				when we&#39;re on air, give me a hand... Try to make
				believe you have more than a one word vocabulary.
				OK pal?

	That does it.  Korben grabs him by the collar and drags him into a
corner.
	Loc Rhod&#39;s feet don&#39;t touch the ground.

						KORBEN
					(pissed)
				I didn&#39;t come here to play Dumbo on the radio.
				So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a
				hand, that clear pal?

						LOC RHOD
					(petrified)
				Crystal.

124	INT.  AIRPORT

	The Check-in attendant has two more tickets in her hand.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(alter a moment, reading)
				...Mr. Dallas... Korben Dallas?

	Zorg&#39;s Right Arm gives her a big smile.

						RIGHT ARM
				That&#39;s right.

	The attendant scans the ID with a yellow beam, it checks out, and the
blue light reveals no other face but his.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
				The problem is I only have one Korben Dallas on
				my list... and he&#39;s already checked in.

	Right Arm&#39;s smile shatters.

						RIGHT ARM
				That&#39;s impossible!  He&#39;s in j... I mean, there
				must be some mistake. I have my ticket!
				I&#39;m the real Korben Dallas!

	A shrill BELL rings out.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(smiling)
				I&#39;m sorry, sir, boarding is finished.

	The attendant hits a button.  A thick window slowly slides up between
them.
	Right Arm totally loses it.

						RIGHT ARM
				I want to see your boss!  Get rid of this
				fucking window! Somebody&#39;s made a
				mistake, goddamnit!

	He pounds on the counter with both fists. A steel curtain comes down.
Red sighting beams target spots on his body, ten gun barrels protrude from
the wall, all aimed at him.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This is not an exercise.  This is a police
				control.
				Put your hands in the nearest yellow circles...

						RIGHT ARM
					(slowing down)
				Sorry, my fault... Just a little overexcited...
				that&#39;s all... I&#39;m calm now.

125	INT.  SHUTTLE - DAY

	Korben makes his way in the plane  looking for his seat. No more seats in
modern planes, just individual travel boxes lined up like microwaves.  He
passes STEWARD holding his bloodied nose. He has found what he is looking
for. He enters to.... Leeloo quietly stretched out in front of a computer
screen.  Korben slips in beside her.  Leeloo in concentrating on the words
that scroll rapidly  past her on the screen.  He doesn&#39;t understand what she
is doing.

						LEELOO
				Apipoulai!

						KORBEN
				Not hard to find you...just follow the
				Chaos...

	Leeloo smiles, as if complimented.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo, listen to me... these tickets...
				they&#39;re not mine... I mean they are, but
				not for vacation like everyone thinks...
				I&#39;m on an operation... and if I didn&#39;t come
				get you, you&#39;d be in a shitload of trouble...
				I&#39;d love to be on vacation with you...
				but now.... now I&#39;ve got to work...
				And Leeloo... I would love to work in peace.

	Leeloo types in &quot;LOVE&quot; on the keyboard.

						LEELOO
				Love...

						KORBEN
				Yes! But &quot;love&quot; isn&#39;t the operative word
				here, PEACE is!

	Leeloo types in this new word.

						LEELOO
					(rather pleased)
				Peace... and love...

	She brings up a picture of a 60&#39;s style Hippie flashing a peace sign.
Korben sighs and switches off the screen.

						KORBEN
				Sometimes you can&#39;t learn everything
				from a screen..sometimes it&#39;s better to
				ask someone who has experience..

						LEELOO
					(quite happy)
				What is... Make Love?

	Korben just stares at her for a few minutes.

						KORBEN
				Know what? On that subject maybe you&#39;d
				be better off asking the screen.

	He turns the computer back on.

	ANGLE ON:

	A STEWARDESS walks up the aisle of the shuttle pushing the red buttons on
top of each individual box.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				...to make your flight as short and agreeable
				as possible, our flight attendants are switching
				on the timing sleeper which will regulate your
				sleep during the trip...

	ANGLE ON:

						LEELOO
					(switching off the screen)
				OK! Finished!

						KORBEN
				Finished what?

						LEELOO
				Learning language.

						KORBEN
				Which one?

						LEELOO
				All 900.

	Korben doesn&#39;t know if he should laugh or not.

						KORBEN
				You learned 900 languages in five
				minutes?!

						LEELOO
					(pleased)
				Yes! Now it&#39;s your turn! I learned your
				language, you have to learn mine!

						KORBEN
				I know how to say &quot;Hello&quot;. Teach me how
				to say &quot;Good-bye&quot;, that&#39;s all I need.

						LEELOO
				Apipoussan!

						KORBEN
				Apipoussan?

						LEELOO
				Good! Do you know how we say &quot;make love&quot;?

						KORBEN
					(fumbling)
				Uh...

						LEELOO
				...Hoppi-hoppa.

	Korben literally melts.

						KORBEN
					(to himself)
				Help...

	Luckily, a stewardess smiles at him through the box window.

						STEWARDESS
				Sweet dreams, Mr. Dallas!

	The stewardess sets the timing sleeper.  Korben and Leeloo immediately
fall asleep.

	A STEWARDESS at the other end of the shuttle has a problem.

						STEWARDESS 2
				Mr. Loc Rhod you have to assume
				your individual position.

						LOC RHOD
					(hugging her)
				I don&#39;t want an individual position,
				I want all positions!

						STEWARDESS 2
					(resisting somewhat)
				We&#39;re going to take off soon, Mr. Rhod!

						LOC RHOD
				Now you&#39;re talking!

126	INT.  COCKPIT  FHLOSTON  SPACE  SHUTTLE

	Three CREW MEMBERS prepare for liftoff.

						COPILOT

				Molecular axis authorization. Vector 130.
				Destination Fhloston.

	Stewardess 1 enters the cockpit.

						STEWARDESS 1
				Zone 1. 217 locked. The sleep regulator is OK.

						PILOT
					(checking her out)
				Thanks, Miss.

	The Stewardess leaves with a smile.  A red light flashes on the vast
control panel.

						MECHANIC
				Tell the ground crew we&#39;ve got parasites
				in the landing gear.

127	INT.  AIRPORT  LANDING  STRIP - DAY

	A GROUND CREW MEMBER goes over to the truck parked under one of the
plane&#39;s wings and bangs on the side of it with a shout.

						GROUND CREW MEMBER
				Disinfecting!

	Two DISINFECTORS in hermetically sealed suits exit the truck.  They go
over to the front landing gear and send up a whooshing beam.  The flame
burns everything it touches.  A pack of repugnant creatures falls squealing
from the landing gear.  A small trapdoor is opened under the shuttle and a
huge slightly phosphorescent tube falls out.

128	INT.  AIRPORT  HALL / ZORG&#39;S  OFFICE

	Zorg&#39;s Right Arm is in a phone booth in the middle of the hall.

						RIGHT ARM
				Yeah, it&#39;s me... Put Zorg on.

	He is already sweating.

						ZORG
					(cold)
				I&#39;m listening.

						RIGHT ARM
				The real Korben Dallas is on the plane!
				He took my place.

						ZORG
				This is a joke, right?

129	INT.  SHUTTLE

	Loc Rhod is wrapped around a stewardess like a snake.

						LOC RHOD
				No!! I swear to God! I&#39;ve never been this
				sincere with a human before!

130 EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	TWO GROUND CREW MEMBERS stick an enormous, highly phosphorescant tube
	into the opening.

						GROUND CREW MEMBER
				You&#39;re fueled and ready to go.
				Have a nice flight.

131	INT.  SHUTTLE

						PILOT
					(to copilot)
				Everything ready for liftoff?

132	INT.  CABIN

						STEWARDESS
					(weakly, to Loc Rhod)
				No, no... I&#39;m not ready! I&#39;d like to talk first...

133	INT.  ZORG&#39;S  OFFICE / AIRPORT  HALL

						ZORG
				I cannot hear you. We have a bad

	Right Arm reads off the phone number.

						RIGHT ARM
				278-500-645-321

						ZORG
				I&#39;ll call you back.

134  EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	The runway is now empty. A man slips out of the shadows. It&#39;s Cornelius.
He scurries over to the front landing gear. He pauses for an instant, the
climbs up the wheel well and disappears inside the shuttle.

135	INT.  SHUTTLE

	The pilots are going through the pre-flight check list.

						COPILOT
				Anti static pressure?

						MECHANIC
				Primed.

	The mechanic presses a series of buttons.

136	INT.  CABIN

	Loc Rhod undoes a series of buttons on the stewardess&#39; blouse, behind a
curtain. He whispers a poem.  Impossible to resist him. Outside the
curtain the stewardess&#39; legs rise slowly.

137	EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	On the ground, protective fire curtains rise slowly to contain the engine
exhaust on liftoff.

138	INT.  ZORG&#39;S  OFFICE

	A keyboard slowly appears in front of Zorg.

						ZORG
					(typing the number)
				278... 500...

139	SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:

	The pilot gradually turns the engines up.

						COPILOT
				10 seconds...

						PILOT
				Power increase.

	- The stewardess undergoes a power surge from Loc Rhod that&#39;s about to
lift her of.

	- Zorg finishes gleefully typing in the number.

						ZORG
				3... 2... 1...

	- The engines at full blast.

	- The stewardess in close to screaming.

						PILOT
				Liftoff.

	- The copilot pushes a button.

	- So does Zorg.

	- The engines release their full power.

	- The stewardess screams in ecstasy.

	- In the hall, Right Arm literally explodes along with the phone and
everything else   within 60 feet.

140	INT.  FHLOSTON  SPACE  SHUTTLE

	The stewardess&#39; legs slowly descend and disappear behind the curtain.

141	INT.  COCKPIT

	In the cockpit, the atmosphere loosens up.

						COPILOT
					(relaxing)
				Landing gear secure.  Let&#39;s light one up.

142	INT.  CABIN

	Korben and Leeloo sleep soundly in their box.  Leeloo has a smile on her
face and her hand in Korben&#39;s.

143	EXT.  OUTERSPACE - NIGHT

	The spaceship rockets past us, then suddenly vanishes with amazing speed.
Space is now empty and calm.  Billions of stars glow in perfect silence.


144	EXT.  SPACE

	The nefarious planet in still there, immobile, even larger now, writhing
like a serpent.  Then, suddenly, for no apparent reason, all activity stops
and it becomes gray and cold.

145	INT.  SPACESHIP

	In the Admiral&#39;s starship, scientists watch the measuring device.  One of
the devices suddenly starts working.

						TECHNICIAN
				All right! We&#39;re finally getting something!

146	INT.  PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE

	The Head Scientist stands facing the President, who is looking more tired
than ever.

						HEAD SCIENTIST
				The thing is sending out radio wavelengths!

						PRESIDENT
				What the hell does it want with radio waves?

						HEAD SCIENTIST
				...Probably wants to make a call!

	The President and his Generals look at him in astonishment.

147	INT.  ZORG&#39;S OFFICE

	Picasso purrs contentedly on Zorg&#39;s lap.  The phone rings.

						SECRETARY (O.S.)
				Mr. Shadow on the line.

	Zorg shoots to his feet.  Picasso tumbles to the floor.  Zorg picks up
the phone, both excited and uneasy. He stands there, almost coming to
attention.

						ZORG
				Yes... Zorg here.

	The voice is feeble.  It comes from the far reaches of time, from the
bowels of the universe.

						SHADOW
				Am I disturbing you?

						ZORG
				No... not at all.  Where are you?

	SHADOW&#39;S breathing is awesome.

						SHADOW
				...Not far, now.

						ZORG
				Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen
				and see you at last!

	Zorg brings up a huge screen and pushes a few buttons.

	In the middle of an electronic snowstorm, a blackish, vaguely human,
quiverinq form appears. Two eyes, like lava, give an idea where the head is.
Zorg feels sick.

						SHADOW
				Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?

						ZORG
				Got it.

						SHADOW
				How&#39;s our deal coming along?

						ZORG
					(ill at ease)
				Fine, just fine!  I&#39;ll have the 4 pieces you
				asked for any time now.  But it wasn&#39;t easy.
				My costs have tripled.

	Shadow pauses an instant.  A black slimy liquid starts to ooze from the
top of the screen.  Zorg is feeling worse all the time.

						SHADOW
				Money is of no importance...
				I want the Stones!

	The black liquid oozes all over the screen which starts to melt.  Zorg
sweats profusely,  his legs tremble.

						ZORG
				The Stones will be here. I&#39;ll see to it
				personally!

						SHADOW
				...I can&#39;t wait to be among you.

	Zorg sighs and sits down totally freaked.

148	EXT. ORBIT  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	The space shuttle fills the screen.  It banks left and begins its descent
toward Fhloston, the turquoise planet.  Crystal blue water, perfect white sand
beaches.  A true paradise.

149	INT.  SPACE SHUTTLE

	The stewardess picks up a microphone to make an announcement.

						STEWARDESS
				Ladies and gentlemen, we have begun our
				descent toward Fhloston Paradise...

	Stewardesses walk down the aisles waking the passengers one by one. They
press a button on the door of each box.

	In the corner, Loc Rhod and the stewardess awake with a start and
straighten their clothes quickly.  The stewardess is embarrassed.

						STEWARDESS
					(timidly)
				I wanted to tell you that...

	Loc Rhod puts on his sunglasses and presses a finger to her lips.  He
disappears behind the curtain leaving the sighing stewardess on her own.

150	EXT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	The spaceship descends through some clouds and glides over a vast
turquoise sea.  Fhloston Paradise looms into view.  An enormous oceanliner
floating a dozen yards above the water.  On closer inspection it is more
modern than a traditional oceanliner.  The shuttle draws near, looking
ridiculously small next to the monster.  Like a sardine next to a whale.

151	INT.  COCKPIT

	A blinking light goes on.

						PILOT
				Shit! Parasites in Zone 1. Take a look.

	The 1st Mate heads off.

152	INT.  CABIN

	A stewardess opens Korben&#39;s box door.  He is still heavy with sleep. He
looks over at Leeloo.  She&#39;s not there.

153	EXT.  FHLOSTON

	The tiny space shuttle clings to the huge oceanliner.

154	INT.  COCKPIT

	The Pilot maneuvers the ship into it&#39;s docking area.

						PILOT
				Docking activated.
				You can let the passengers out.

155	INT.  REAR  OF  COCKPIT

	The 1st mate pries open the door to an overhead panel.  Cornelius falls
out, hanging in a jumble of wires.

156.	INT.  ENTRANCE  HALL  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	The enormous door opens and the passengers exit.  Leeloo is among them.
She appears quite impressed by the beauty and luxury of the 19th century
decoration.

157	INT.  CABIN

	Korben attempts to make his way up the shuttle&#39;s aisle.

						KORBEN
					(jostling everybody)
				Pardon me.  Excuse me. I&#39;m trying to
				reach my wife.. Sorry!

158	INT.  ENTRANCE  HALL

	A dozen policemen wait patiently at the end of the hall.  Leeloo stops
and presses against the wall.  She spots Korben leaving the shuttle.  A
gorgeous HOSTESS comes up to him, drapes a lei around his neck and plants a
kiss on his lips in welcome.

						HOSTESS
					(smiling)
				Welcome to Paradise.

	Korben&#39;s face is covered in lipstick.  Leeloo sees he did nothing to stop
the girl and she doesn&#39;t like it.

	A HEFTY MAN wearing a sarong drapes some flowers around her neck.  Then,
	obviously relishing it, he leans down to kiss her.  Leeloo bashes him on
the forehead.  The hefty man straightens up.  He&#39;s still smiling, but his
nose is bleeding. He falls slowly to the floor.

	Korben pushes forward trying to spot Leeloo.  He also tries to wipe the
lipstick off.  Leeloo tries to escape through a door marked PERSONNEL ONLY,
but it&#39;s locked.  A HOST looks at her with a grin.

						HOST
					(playful)
				If you don&#39;t have the code you can&#39;t
				open it!

	Leeloo smiles and punches in an old code and twists the doorknob.  The
door opens with the sound of a braking lock.  Leeloo smiles sweetly and enters
as if nothing were amiss.

	A shriek of joy fills the room.  Korben turns around.  The HOSTESSES
cluster around Loc Rhod as he comes out of the plane.  Loc Rhod spots Korben
and latches onto his arm.  It&#39;s not going to be easy to remain discrete.

						LOC RHOD
					(relieved)
				My main man! Please don&#39;t leave me here
				alone. My head&#39;s killing me and my adoring
				fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta
				here!

						KORBEN
				I&#39;ll take you to the bar, after that,
				you&#39;re on your own.

						LOC RHOD
					(hanging on to Korben)
				Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right,
				man. Tell me all about yourself, your
				roots, your personal life, your childhood
				dreams...

						KORBEN
				I don&#39;t think this is a good time...

						LOC RHOD
				...You got brothers and sisters? What
				about your dad? Tell me about your
				dad! What was he like? Physically?
				Big, I suppose?

						KORBEN
					(evasive)
				Yeah, very big, a giant.

						LOC RHOD
				I didn&#39;t have a dad... never saw him...
				never even heard him. 50 billion people
				listen to me every day... and he doesn&#39;t
				hear me...

159	INT.  SMALL  ROOM  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	Leeloo is in a small room, ear at the door, listening. Everything seems
normal. She turns and discovers the room for what it is:	a rest room
for... three cops who look up from their books and stare blankly at her.
Leeloo doesn&#39;t know what to do. So she smiles.

	The door opens.  The HOSTESS turns on the light and enters.  Korben
follows her, gaping at all the luxury.

	The BAGGAGE BOY enters bringing Leeloo&#39;s two suitcases.

	Korben grabs the notice announcing Diva Plavalaguna&#39;s concert at 5:30 in
that evening.  Dress: Formal attire.

						KORBEN
				For the concert it says formal attire...
				I didn&#39;t bring...

	The hostess pulls back the closet door.  Twenty tuxedos in a row.

						HOSTESS
					(looking him over)
				Here&#39;s some champagne. I&#39;ll drop by after
				the concert to open it.

	She gives him a blinding smile and closes the door.

	Korben pushes a button.  The curtains open to reveal a most spectacular
view of the turquoise planet.  Stars shoot out into infinity.
Breathtaking.  Korben stands gaping.  The phone rings, snapping him out of
his reverie.

						KORBEN
				Hello?

						MOTHER (O.S.)
				You little sleaze bag!

						KORBEN
				...Ma???

						MOTHER (O.S.)
				Don&#39;t you ever ask me for another thing
				in my life again, you&#39;ve killed your

	Korben drops into an armchair and sighs. His eyes go to the ceiling.

				I want maximum security.

						FOG
				Yes. Sir!

						CHIEF OF POLICE
					(to Cornelius)
				OK, let&#39;s hear it.

						CORNELIUS
				Where was I?

						CHIEF OF POLICE
					(bored)
				...You open the door. There&#39;s a cabby with
				a girl in his arms.

	FOG opens the door.  Two COPS come hobbling in all bloody and bandaged.
They hold up a THIRD COP.

						CHIEF OF POLICE
				What happened?
				A bomb go off in your face?

						BEAT-UP COP
				Yeah... A 5 foot 7 inch bomb...
				with green eyes.

	Cornelius perks up.

						CORNELIUS
				And the smile of an angel?

	They all turn to look at him.

						CORNELIUS
					(to Chief)
				May I speak to you alone.

167	INT.  CORRIDOR  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	Leeloo watches the Diva&#39;s arrival.  A door opens and two POLICEMAN clear
the way for DIVA PLAVALAGUNA, her MANAGER, her BODYGUARDS and a gaggle of
	PORTERS carrying trunks.

	Not wanting to draw attention to herself, Leeloo feigns interest in a
painting that is obviously upside down. A white chiffon veil covers the face
of the Diva, she stops in front of Leeloo.  The Diva reaches out and
strokes Leeloo&#39;s face, without touching her. The Diva removes her hand
making a sound of crackling electricity, then passes on.  Leeloo is groggy.
The Diva&#39;s ASSISTANT comes up to her.

						DIVA&#39;S ASSISTANT
				Please forgive this little incident. She wants
				you to know that she senses great powers in
				you... in the service of a noble cause... She
				will give you what you have come to get, but
				she wants to sing first...
				One last time...

	The Diva&#39;s assistant turns the painting right side up.

						DIVA&#39;S ASSISTANT
					(nodding)
				Miss.

	Leeloo looks at the painting, seems to understand it better.

168	EXT.  DIVA&#39;S  SUITE

	Policemen stand at attention in front of the Diva&#39;s suite.

						FOG
				Hello, I&#39;m head of security.
				Everything is in order. You can...

	The Diva enters her suite without letting him finish.

						FOG
				...make yourselves at home safely.
				If you need anything...give it a knock!

169	INT.  POLICE  OFFICE  HALLWAY - NIGHT

	A door opens near the police officer&#39;s main entrance. Cornelius looks
both ways. Then crosses the hall, dragging the Chief of Police by the feet.

170	INT.  KORBEN&#39;S  STATEROOM

	Korben finishes putting on his tux, still on the phone.

						KORBEN
				Listen, Ma! I&#39;ve only got a few days
				vacation and I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m
				gonna spend them on the phone.

	The door RINGS.

						KORBEN
				...Hang on, it&#39;s the door. No!
				I told you I didn&#39;t bring anybody!
				I&#39;m all alone... as usual!

	Korben opens the door.  It&#39;s not the champagne.  Even better. It&#39;s
Leeloo.

						KORBEN
					(to his mother)
				...I&#39;ll call you back.

	Leeloo heads right for her suitcase and starts to undress.  Korben has to
turn away once more.

						KORBEN
				Here we go again...

						LEELOO
					(by rote)
				You know women normally change five
				times more than men.

						KORBEN
				You get that off the screen?

						LEELOO
				Yes... you know there&#39;s a lot of
				differences between men women.

						KORBEN
				You noticed..

						LEELOO
				OK, you can turn around!

	Korben turns around.  Leeloo has put on a very simple dress which is sexy
to the max.  He is smitten.  So much so that Leeloo wonders if something
isn&#39;t quite right.

						KORBEN
				Where you going?

						LEELOO
				I&#39;m going to see the Diva sing. What&#39;s
				the matter?... Do I look bad?

						KORBEN
				No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite,
				you&#39;re... you&#39;re beautiful!

	Leeloo smiles at him, his compliment pleases her.  She turns, revealing
her unzippered back.  Korben cannot help but stare at her bare flesh.  Her
perfect bottom.

						LEELOO
				Do you know how this works?

	Korben&#39;s blood boils.  She wriggles, pressing her hands together close to
the zipper.

						KORBEN
				I have an idea.

	But instead of pulling on the zipper he slips a bracelet on her wrist.  A
flourescent beam bursts out of the bracelet and forms a vertical bar going
from the floor to the ceiling.
	Stunned, Leeloo is held captive.

						KORBEN
				I told you I need to work in peace.
				Remember? I need to concentrate.

						LEELOO
				And you can&#39;t concentrate with me
				around?.

						KORBEN
				It&#39;s difficult.

	She tries to breakout.

						KORBEN
				Army issue. I&#39;m sorry.

	Leeloo tries desperately to get out of the handcuffs. Impossible.

	Korben sets the radio down in front of her and turns it on.
	Leeloo looks like she&#39;d like to break his head.

						LEELOO
					(seething)
				You&#39;re nothing but a... a...

						KORBEN
				The words you&#39;re looking for weren&#39;t
				in the dictionary you studied. I won&#39;t
				be long.

	The door flies open.  Loc Rhod barges in.

						LOC RHOD
				Hey Stud we gotta...

	Then he sees the scene, Leeloo cuffed, in a low cut dress.  His mind goes
to the obvious.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben my man what&#39;s happening here?
				Who&#39;s the chick? What&#39;s the gig?
				We free forming here? Getting funky
				with the monkey? Can I get in on this?

	Korben grabs him by the collar..

						KORBEN
				No..to all of the above.

	And yanks Loc Rhod out of the room.  Leaving Leeloo looking extremely
unhappy.

Opera in Paris.  A hostess escorts them to their seats.

						LOC RHOD
					(broadcasting)
				We have just walked into what is probably
				the most beautiful concert hall in the universe.
				Totally awesome! Magnificent paintings on the
				ceiling. I don&#39;t know who painted them, but he
				must have busted his balls! I see a row of former
				ministers, more sinister than minister! A few generals
				practicing how to sleep. And there&#39;s Baby Ray, star
				of stage and screen, drowning in a sea of nymphets.
				He&#39;s not gonna get much out of this concert, he&#39;s
				stone-deaf!

	ANGLE ON:

	Baby Ray bending his ear to a girl asking for an autograph.

						BABY RAY
				...to who?

						LOC RHOD
					(moving down the aisle)
				...And over there is Roy Von Bacon, the king
				of laserball and the best paid player in the League.
					(shakes hands as he goes by)
				...And over there is the Emperor Kodar Japhet
				whose daughter Aachen is still at the bar.
				&quot;I love to sing, too, but in the shower&quot;, she
				recently confessed to me. She will no doubt
				prove to be as generous tonight as she always is.

	A waiter gives them two glasses of champagne.  Track with the WAITER an
he leaves the hall with his empty tray.  He enters a small room reserved for
staff.

177	INT.  STAFF  ROOM  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT

	The waiter joins some other WAITERS.  They are well armed.  He opens a
cupboard and pulls out a humongous weapon. Suddenly their faces burn off
revealing AKANIT, the young leader of the Mangalores, and his troops.

						AKANIT

	Leeloo, still a prisoner, listens to the concert.

181	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben is tense.  The curtain rises.  The Diva, in a stunning gown,
stands in the center of the stage, head bowed.  Behind her, a star filled
window.  The MUSIC begins.  The Diva looks up, a rare beauty, but an alien.
And then she begins to sing.  Her voice is divine, unmatched.  Korben is
swept up in the TEARS.

182	INT.  KORBEN&#39;S  SUITE

	Leeloo has tears in her eyes

183	INT.  DIVA&#39;S  SUITE

	The manager couldn&#39;t care less about the concert.  His main problem is
the bottle of scotch he can&#39;t seem to open.  The doorbell RINGS.

						MANAGER
					(ugly mood)
				Yeah!?

						VOICE (O.S.)
				Flowers for the Diva.

						MANAGER
				She&#39;s allergic to flowers!!!

						VOICE (O.S.)
				There&#39;s champagne as well...

	The manager takes one look at the stubborn bottle and opens the door. And
finds himself staring down the barrel of a gun. A dozen Mangalores rush
in. One of them, with a human face, closes the door and waits out in the hall.

	ANGLE ON:

	Cornelius watching from around the corner.

						CORNELIUS
				...My God!

	FLASHBACK:

	The same ships with Mangalores at the controls attack the Mondoshawans at
the beginning of our story.

188	INT.  KORBEN&#39;S  SUITE

	Leeloo is alarmed.  She has to act.  She seizes the flourescent bar beam
with great effort and rams it into the ceiling, marking a hole large enough
for her to escape.

189	INT.  CLOSET  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	Cornelius bursts into the closet he left the Chief of Police tied and
gagged in.  He quickly unties him.

						CORNELIUS

				Mangalores! The Diva&#39;s suite! They want
				the Sacred Stones! They must be stopped.
				We must stop them!. I&#39;m going to free you
				but you must promise to help me!

	The Chief of Police nods his agreement.

190	INT.  DIVA&#39;S  SUITE

	The Mangalores have trashed the suite.  One of the Mangalores finally
finds a case engraved with the four elements.

						MANGALORE
				I have it.

	The Mangalore is about to open the case when... Leeloo descends quietly
and gracefully from the ceiling.  Time stands still.

	A WARRIOR whips out the biggest knife ever made and rushes Leeloo.  She

Leeloo dances.  The Mangalores pay a heavy price for the show.

193	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Hearing noise from inside the suite, the Mangalore by the door gets

				...Now hand over the Stones!

	Leeloo smiles and hands him the case.  Zorg arms the ZF1 and gets ready
to kill her.

						ZORG
				Nice knowing you.

	Leeloo catches on quickly.  She kicks the scotch bottle on the floor into
the gun which throws Zorg&#39;s shot off.  She jumps to the ceiling and
disappears in an air vent.  Furious, Zorg fires at the ceiling.

198	INT.	AIRSHAFT

	Leeloo dodges the bullets as best as she can.

199	INT.  SUITE

	Zorg fires his 3000 round clip.  The ceiling looks like a piece of swiss
cheese.  Zorg sticks a small cylinder in the wall and flicks it on.  The
numbers flashing by tell us it&#39;s a bomb.  The timer reads: 19 minutes and 59
seconds.

						ZORG
					(with a crafty smile)
				You can run but you can&#39;t hide...

200	INT.  POLICE  OFFICE  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT

	Cornelius is seated opposite the Chief of Police.  A MEDIC is bandaging
the chief&#39;s head.  The door explodes.  The cop outside in riddled with
bullets.  A dozen Mangalores attack the police office.  Akanit is at
their head.  The policemen are caught unaware.

						AKANIT
				Nobody move! We&#39;re taking over this
				ship!

	The Chief of Police is goggle-eyed.  Cornelius leans toward him.

						CORNELIUS
					(pleased with himself)
				I told you...

201	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Zorg has the case and exits the suite just as the general alarm goes off.
	He sighs in exasperation.

202	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Three Mangalores suddenly rush into the opera hall shooting.

						MANGALORE 1
				Everyone down!

	There is panic all around.

						LOC RHOD
					(broadcasting, panic stricken)
				Ladies and gentlemen, I think we&#39;re being...
				attacked.  The place is crawling with warriors.

203	INT.  PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE

	President Lindberg and his generals look very worried.

204	INT.  CONCERT HALL

	Some security guards open fire one of the Mangalores is hit.  The others
turn their guns on the cops.  People scream, diving for cover.  Korben bides
his time.

	More Mangalores rush in from all around shooting.  Two cops are killed.
	The Diva... takes a bullet.

	She falls from the stage into Korben&#39;s arms. He lowers her to the floor.
Korben ignores the panic all around and wraps her in his dinner jacket,
trying to stop the blue blood spurting from her wounds.

205	EXT./ INT.  SPACE  AROUND  FHLOSTON

	Zorg&#39;s ZFX200 speeds away from the boat.  Zorg is at the controls, a
devilish smile on his lips.

						ZORG
				You want something done, do it yourself!

206	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Fighting rages all around in the concert hall, but Korben is oblivious to
it.  He sets the Diva&#39;s head delicately on the floor.  Loc Rhod is hidden
nearby, still on the air.

						LOC RHOD
					(voice low, panicked)
				They&#39;re hideous. They&#39;ve got a crest on
				the head, the eyes of a toad and fingers
				all over their hands. Totally hideous!

207	INT.  PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE.

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				...Mangalores!

						PRESIDENT
				Send a battalion out immediately!

208	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

						KORBEN
					(to the Diva)
				I was sent by the government to help you.

						DIVA
				Don&#39;t worry.  This is my fate...
				How was the concert?

	Korben is a little surprised, but... the Diva is an artist.

						KORBEN
				I&#39;ve never heard anything so beautiful
				in my life.

	A Mangalore jumps on them from the stage.  Korben makes short work of him
and grabs his gun.

						DIVA
					(weak)
				You&#39;re a good man...
				She was right to have chosen you...

						KORBEN
				Who?

						DIVA
				The Fifth Element...
				The Supreme Being... Your wife...

	Korben is floored.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo... is... she&#39;s...

						DIVA
				Yes, and more than that... You must
				give her the Stones, she&#39;s the only one
				who knows how to use them.

						KORBEN
					(to himself, suddenly
					realizing)
				...So Cornelius was telling the truth!

209	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	The Mangalores tie up Cornelius and the Chief of Police together.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the Chief of Police)
				Of course I was telling you the truth!...
				If you had listened to me in the first place,
				we wouldn&#39;t be in this predicament now!

210	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben wastes two more Mangalores.

						DIVA
				She needs you. She needs your help and
				your love. She&#39;s more fragile than she seems...

	Korben looks around, ready for another attack.

						KORBEN
				...Yeah, so am I.

	The Diva takes his hand.

						DIVA
				She was taught to love the life of others...
				but not her own. You have to teach her
				to love if you want her to truly live!

						KORBEN
					(uncomfortable)
				I&#39;ll help her, I promise, but I think you
				should tell me where the Stones are!

						DIVA
				Do you love her?

						KORBEN
				I... I don&#39;t know! We hardly know
				each other... it takes time!

						DIVA
				I don&#39;t have time... I need to know.

						KORBEN
				Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman
				I loved her ... I never saw her again.

						DIVA
				I would like to have died in peace...

	The Diva&#39;s eyes close.

211	INT.  DIVA&#39;S  SUITE

	The timer on Zorg&#39;s bomb clicks over to &quot;15 minutes&quot;.

212	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

						KORBEN
				You tell me to save the world then
				you go off and leave me in the shit!

	He shakes her, gently slapping her cheeks.

						KORBEN
				Come on! You&#39;re not gonna die in peace!
				You&#39;re not going to die at all! You hear me?
				Where are the Stones?

213	INT.  SPACESHIP

	Zorg sets the Sacred Case on a table in the cockpit.  He opens it with a
complacent smile:		It&#39;s empty!

	He cannot believe his eyes.  He goes berserk, destroying everything in
sight.

214	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben slaps the Diva soundly.  She comes around somewhat.

						KORBEN
				I&#39;m sorry, but... the Stones...

						DIVA
					(very weak)
				They are... with me...

	The Diva dies.  Blue blood streams from her mouth.  Korben frisks the
Diva but doesn&#39;t find anything.  The shooting slowly stops in the theatre.
The Mangalores are now in total control.

						MANGALORE 2
				Stay calm and nobody will get hurt!
				Hands on your head and into the hall!

	The guests comply

						KORBEN
					(to himself)
				...The Stones are with me?

	and then it occurs to him.

						KORBEN
				...In me?

	He touches the Diva&#39;s stomach and senses something hard.  Girding
himself, he sticks his hand in the wound and pulls out a Sacred Stone.
Then another.  And another.  Korben pulls out all four Stones, covered in blue
blood.  Everyone has left the theater.  The Mangalores check the aisles one
by one.

	Loc Rhod peeks out from under a seat.

						LOC RHOD
				Don&#39;t you think we&#39;d better be going?

	A Mangalore spots Korben kneeling alongside the Diva.  He grabs Korben by
the shoulder and pokes him with his gun.

						MANGALORE
				Hey, you! With the others!

	Korben spins and, in one swift motion, breaks his arm.  Just for
starters.  Another WARRIOR rushes over.  Korben punches him into oblivion
and snatches the gun.

						KORBEN
				That&#39;s it... I&#39;ve had... all day people
				have been sticking guns in my face...

	Korben wraps up the four Stones in his shirt.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben man... These dudes are going
				to waste us if we don&#39;t do what they say.

	Korben gives him the package and grabs his mike.

						KORBEN
				You don&#39;t do what I say... I&#39;ll waste
				you myself. Got it?

						LOC RHOD
				Got it...

215	INT.  PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE

	President Lindberg dabs his sweaty face with a towel.

216	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Akanit is still in the police station facing control screens.  He barks
into a
	walkie-talkie.

						AKANIT
				What&#39;s the situation in the hall?

217	INT.  HALL

	Hostages are being gathered in the middle of the hall.  They are
surrounded by Mangalores who guard them.

						MUGGER
					(into walkie-talkie)
				There&#39;s no more resistance.
				Everything&#39;s under control.

	Three Mangalores are suddenly blasted through the glass door leading to
the theater.  Korben bursts into the hall, two huge guns in his hands.

						KORBEN
				Everybody down!

	Korben takes out two more WARRIORS coming towards him, rolls behind a
column.
	Laser bullets stinging all around his head.

						LOC RHOD
				This is amazing! Korben, Korben Dallas,
				the winner of the Gemini Croquette
				contest just killed three warriors like he was
				swatting flies...

	Panic everywhere!  Heavy firing fills the hall.

	ANGLE ON:

	Roy von Bacon, the laserball player, rises from the floor behind a
Mangalore, grabs him and smashes his head into a column, seizing the gun.

	ANGLE ON:

	Two Mangalores firing a huge machine gun at the column Korben is using
for cover.
	He dives for cover behind the bar.

	ANGLE ON:

	Two Mangalores watch awestruck.  Roy whistles behind them.  The two
Mangalores turn around.  Roy bonks their heads together.

						LOC RHOD
				It&#39;s Roy von Bacon, the Lions center
				forward joining in the battle...

	Someone taps Loc Rhod on the shoulder.  He jumps with fright.

						PRINCESS AACHEN
					(hot to trot)
				All this is terribly exciting, hmmm?

	Loc Rhod covers his mike.

						LOC RHOD
				GET OFF MY BACK!

	A Mangalore shoots in their direction.  Loc Rhod flattens himself on the
floor.  A vase falls on the Princess knocking her out.  A Mangalore loads
some missiles in his gun and destroys the bar piece by piece forcing Korben to
move forward.  Korben motions to Baby Ray hiding under the pool table.

						KORBEN
				Toss me the balls!

						BABY RAY
					(terrified, still deaf)
				What?

	Another piece of the bar explodes.

						KORBEN
				The balls for Christ&#39;s sake!

	Korben apes playing pool, but Baby Ray really is stone-deaf.

						EMPEROR JAPHET
				He wants the balls! You deaf or something?

	The EMPEROR rolls the balls over to Korben.  The Mangalore loads more
missiles and shatters another part of the bar.  Korben hides behind the last
bit left.

						KORBEN
				How far is he from here?

	The EMPEROR glances at the Mangalore, who in reloading.

						EMPEROR
				I&#39;d say about thirty yards to the left.

	Korben hefts the ball, jumps up and hurls it with blinding  speed.  The
Mangalore catches it right in the head.  He drops, firing in the air.  The
missile strikes the ceiling which collapses on him.  The emperor gives Korben
a thumb&#39;s up.

						LOC RHOD
				...And our man Korben has literally
				knocked out the opposition with an
				amazing 90 foot pitch.

	The COPS on the floor rise, scoop up weapons from dead Mangalores and lay
down a line of fire at the last of the fleeing rebels . Roy whirls his arm
in victory.

						FOG
				Thanks for your help.

						KORBEN
				Forget it.

	Korben grabs Loc Rhod and takes him with him.

218	INT.  KORBEN&#39;S  SUITE

	Korben bursts into the room. He stares at the luminous bar still struck
to the ground and sees the hole Leeloo escaped through.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo???

219	INT.  DIVA&#39;S  SUITE - CEILING

	Leeloo in bleeding all over.  She can barely move.

policemen already there.

						COP 1
				Hey, who are you?

						KORBEN
				The winner of the Gemini Croquette contest.

	Korben goes to the door and peeks around the corner.  Loc Rhod arrives.

						KORBEN
				Seven to the left. Five to the right.

						COP
				What&#39;s he doing?

	Korben leans around the corner and fires rapidly.

						KORBEN
				Six to the left. One to the right.

						LOC RHOD
				He&#39;s on vacation.

						KORBEN
					(reloading)
				We got to find the leader. Mangalores
				don&#39;t fight without a leader.

223	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Akanit gets up, grabs Cornelius by the throat and put a gun to his head.

						AKANIT
				One more shot and we start killing
				hostages, got that?

224	INT.  POLICE  STATION  HALLWAY

						KORBEN
				Found him...

						AKANIT
					(tense)

				Mind if I go? I&#39;m an excellent

				Uh... Sure, go ahead.

	Korben gets ready.

						COP 1
				We&#39;re sending someone in who&#39;s
				authorized to negotiate.

225	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Korben walks quickly into the room, heads straight for Akanit, raises his
gun and puts a bullet through his head.

						KORBEN
				Anyone else want to negotiate?

						COP 2
					(to another Cop)
				Where&#39;d he learn to negotiate like that?

	The President gives Munro a hard look.

227	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM

	The police round up the remaining Mangalores.  Korben is at the control
center screens trying to find Leeloo.  Cornelius comes over to him,
embarrassed.

						CORNELIUS
				You&#39;re probably very angry with me and
				I quite understand. But I want you to
				know I&#39;m fighting for a noble cause.

						KORBEN
				Yeah, I know... to save the world... but
				right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo&#39;s in trouble?

						KORBEN
				When is she not in trouble?

						CORNELIUS
				Uh.. Have you tried the Diva&#39;s suite?

	Korben realizes that Cornelius in probably right.

228	INT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE  LANDING  DOCK  AND  GARAGE

	The ZFX200 settles in the landing dock garage.  SECURITY POLICE approach
the ship just as Zorg in getting out holding the ZF1.

				Nothing I can&#39;t fix myself.

	He brings up the ZF1 and wipes out the garage.

	Korben enters the Diva&#39;s suite which is in shambles.  He looks

231	INT.  DIVA&#39;S SUITE

	Exhausted, Loc Rhod wipes his forehead and finds himself face to face
with the bomb stuck on the wall.

	Korben in busy looking for Leeloo.

						KORBEN
					(loudly)
				Leeloo?

	Up in the airshaft, Leeloo has heard him.

						LEELOO
				Korben...

	Her voice is too weak, Korben can&#39;t hear her.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben man... what the hell is this?

	Korben gives the bomb a prefunctory glance.

						KORBEN
				A molecular bomb.

	Three minutes left on the timer.

						LOC RHOD
					(increasingly worried)
				And, uh, what&#39;re these numbers clicking
				by?

						CORNELIUS
				Probably the time remaining before it
				explodes.

	Cornelius smiles and continues his search.

						LOC RHOD
					(weak smile)
				You&#39;re just saying that to scare me! Right?
				If it was a bomb, an alarm would&#39;ve gone off.
				There&#39;s bomb detectors in all these hotels!

				Not without Leeloo.

	Loc Rhod cannot take his eyes off the bomb.

						LOC RHOD
				Like D-Man, I hate to bother you but uh,
				like, we&#39;re down to 2 minutes here...

	Korben breathes out, bothered.  He turns his attention to the bomb.

						KORBEN
				It&#39;s the latest model.. I&#39;ve never seen one
				before... it works off a magnetic coded
				card... Let&#39;s see if I can rig it up.

235	INT.  AIRSHAFT

	Leeloo sticks her fingers out one of the bullet holes and lets some of
her blood drip down.

	The blood splats on Korben&#39;s hand.  He snaps his head up and knows
immediately who is up there.  He forgets about the bomb.

						LOC RHOD
				Hey! What are you doing? The bomb!

	Korben drags the desk over, jumps on it and pokes his head in the torn up
airshaft He spots Leeloo who gives him a weak smile.

						KORBEN
				Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m here now!

	He pulls her toward him, helps her out of the shaft and stretches her out
on the desk.

						KORBEN
				Just relax. I&#39;ve got the Stones.
				Everything&#39;s going to be fine.

	30 seconds left on the timer.

						LOC RHOD
					(falling to pieces)
				Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of
				your time here?

						KORBEN
					(to Leeloo)
				I&#39;ll be right back.

	Korben dashes over to the bomb.  He is stopped by the barrel of the ZF1.
Zorg, in person, holding a magnetic card.

						ZORG
					(smiling)
				Allow me...

	Zorg slips a small magnetic card in the bomb, it starts to count down
from 5 minutes.

						ZORG
				Just for the fun of it.

	Loc Rhod faints.

						ZORG
				Well, what do we have here? Is this
				Korben Dallas? The famous winner of
				the Gemini Croquette contest?
				Or is this Korben Dallas from Special
				Section sent by old Lindberg himself.

	Korben doesn&#39;t reply.

						ZORG
				...In any event, whoever you are,
				I was glad to meet you.

	Zorg fires at Korben who figures he is dead.  Nothing.  Zorg tries again.
Nada.  The clip is empty.  Zorg starts to panic.

						ZORG
				...A 3000 round clip! I didn&#39;t fire off
				3000 rounds... did I?

						KORBEN
				Don&#39;t you know how to count.
				It&#39;s not all that hard. Watch!

	Korben punches him square in the face, shows him his index.

						KORBEN
				One! That&#39;s for trying to kill me!

	Second Punch.

						KORBEN
				Two! That&#39;s for firing me! Three!
				That&#39;s for pushing around a priest!
				And the rest is for what you did to
				my wife!

	Korben pummels him mercilessly.

236	INT.  PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE

	Zorg falls to the floor, beaten to a pulp.  The timer clicks over to 3
minutes.

	Her eyes close and she falls back asleep.  Korben is worried.  She seems
so depressed.  Cornelius enters.

						CORNELIUS
				There&#39;s a General on the phone...
				His name&#39;s Mambo, I think.

256	INT.  PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE

						MUNRO
				Munro here. President Lindberg wants
				to talk to you.  Hold the line.

	The President clears his throat and takes the phone.

						PRESIDENT
				Major, first off, I want to thank you,
				in my name and in the name of the
				Federation...

257	INT.  ZFX200 / PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE

						PRESIDENT (O.S.)
				For the praiseworthy courage you have
				shown us! I&#39;d like to congratulate General
				Munro for his choice. He found the ideal
				man for such a...

						KORBEN
					(to the point)
				So now what&#39;s the problem?

	The President drops into his armchair and sighs.

						PRESIDENT
				There&#39;s a ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter
				heading straight for the earth. And we have
				no idea how to stop it! ...That&#39;s the problem.

	Korben thinks fast.  The Priest is with him.  The Five Elements are on
board.

						KORBEN
				How much time before the collision?

	The President queries the scientist with a nod of the head.

						SCIENTIST
				If its speed remains constant... in an
				hour and 57 minutes.

						KORBEN (O.S.)
				I&#39;ll call you back in two hours.

	Korben hangs up.  The President looks stunned.

258	EXT.  SPACE

	The ZFX200 shifts to the speed of light and vanishes in the star-studded
cosmos.

259	INT.  CHAPEL

	David is asleep.  He is woken by the sound of...

260	EXT.  DESERT - DAWN

	The ZFX200 is parked in the middle of the desert.

	Korben walks ahead carrying Leeloo.  Cornelius has the four Stones with
him.
	Barely awake, Loc Rhod stumbles along.  David appears at the door of the
chapel.

						DAVID
				You&#39;re all safe. Thanks be to God!

						CORNELIUS
				Later, David! Later!
				There&#39;s not a minute to lose!

	The small group enters the chapel.

261	INT.  CHAPEL

	Cornelius pushes the group onto the altar which is surrounded by a wooden
barrier.  Cornelius stands in front of the cross.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me, Father, but... could we pray
				later?

	Cornelius bends the cross and pushes it down.  A mechanism is set off
lowering the altar like a service elevator.

	The altar descends amid rocky walls.

262	INT.  PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE

						MUNRO
				They just landed in the desert.

						PRESIDENT
					(sweating)
				How much time is left?

263	EXT.  SPACE

	Earth is in view.  The Dark Planet fills the screen and heads for the
blue planet.

264	INT.  PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE

						SCIENTIST
				About nine minutes.

	President Lindberg has trouble breathing.

265	INT.  TEMPLE

	Lit by torches, Korben sets Leeloo delicately on the altar in the exact
center of the four elements.  Cornelius looks over the four Stones every
which way.

						CORNELIUS
					(panic-stricken)
				Uh, this one... must be water!

	It&#39;s obvious he doesn&#39;t know where to put it.

						KORBEN
				Don&#39;t tell me you don&#39;t know how all
				this works?

						CORNELIUS
				Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form
				the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed
				to stand in the middle there, but...
				I don&#39;t have the reference book.
				I&#39;ve never seen the Stones work!

	Korben can&#39;t believe his ears.  He tears the Stone out of Cornelius&#39; hand
and studies the inscriptions.  He goes over to one of the four bases the
stones rest on and tries to figure it out.  The symbol of air is on the Stone,
the same as on the base.

						KORBEN
				Match the symbols!

	Korben places the first Stone and picks up another one.  Cornelius has
found the symbol for water.  Loc Rhod sits down.  He is very tired.

						LOC RHOD
				What is this some kinda game? Like
				chess?

	Korben pulls him to his feet and sticks a Stone in his hands.

						KORBEN
				No. It&#39;s much simpler. If we don&#39;t figure
				out where these Stones go in five minutes,
				we&#39;re all dead! Think you got it?

	Loc Rhod&#39;s got it and runs over to put in his Stone.  The four Stones are
all in place but nothing happens.

						KORBEN
				There&#39;s no light! You told me there were
				supposed to be four beams of light.

						CORNELIUS
					(lost)
				Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut!
				They have to be open for it to work.

						KORBEN
				And you don&#39;t know how they open,
				is that what you are saying?

						CORNELIUS
				That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying.

266	EXT.  SPACE

	The Dark Planet closes in on Earth rapidly.

267	INT.  CHAPEL

	Korben leans over Leeloo.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open
				them! How does it work?

						LEELOO
					(feeble)
				The wind blows... the fire burns...

						KORBEN
				I know all that, Leeloo! I&#39;m talking
				about the Stones.

						LEELOO
				...The rain falls...

	Korben is desperate.  Leeloo&#39;s too weak, he won&#39;t get anything more out
of her.
	He darts over to a Stone and turns it over and over.

						KORBEN
				The rain falls... the wind blows?

	Loc Rhod stands in front of his Stone looking at Korben.

						KORBEN
				Try and figure out how this fucking thing
				opens, instead of staring at me like that!

	Loc Rhod starts feeling the Stone all around.

						LOC RHOD
					(afraid)
				I&#39;m looking, I&#39;m looking.

268	INT.  PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE

	The tension is palpable in the President&#39;s office.

						SCIENTIST
				...Three minutes.

						MUNRO
				We&#39;ve lost contact with them.

269	INT.  CHAPEL

	Korben and Cornelius turn the Stones every which way.  All to no avai1.
Loc Rhod is discouraged.

						LOC RHOD
				...we&#39;ll never make it.

	He sighs.  Three hooks pop off the Stone.  Loc Rhod can&#39;t believe his
eyes.

						LOC RHOD
				It... it moved! Korben! Korben!

	Korben rushes over, looks at the Stone.  Hooks are undone.

						KORBEN
				What did you say? What did you do?

						LOC RHOD
				Nothing! Swear to God, I didn&#39;t do
				nothing!

						KORBEN
				Look, you did something that set it off.
				Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me
				exactly what you did!!

	Loc Rhod tries to duplicate the same movement.

						LOC RHOD
				I was like this... With my hands here and...
				I said, &quot;We&#39;ll never make it!&quot; That&#39;s all!

	Nothing happens.

						KORBEN
				Is that all?

						LOC RHOD
				Yeah... then I sighed... like this.

	Loc Rhod sighs, really depressed this time.  The Stone opens even more.
	Korben&#39;s got it.

						KORBEN
				The wind! The wind blows...

	Korben blows on the Stone which immediately opens revealing a patch of
blue sky with some miniature clouds floating around inside.  A yellow beam
pops up like a ray of sunlight, like Korben&#39;s smile.

						KORBEN
				Quickly, everyone on a Stone!
				Water for water!  Fire for fire!
				Earth for earth!

	The two men move fast.  Korben on the 4th Stone: Earth.  He grabs a
fistful of earth  and throws it on the Stone.  A miniature patch of green
appears and immediately forms a green beam.  Cornelius wipes his forehead
with a scarf and wrings it out over the Stone.  It opens revealing a patch of
miniature raging sea.  A blue beam appears.

	Loc Rhod has a problem.

						LOC RHOD
					(shaking)
				I don&#39;t have a light.  I stopped smoking
				last week! If we&#39;d come a bit sooner...

	Korben pats his pockets, he comes up with a box of matches.  There&#39;s only
one left.

						KORBEN
				Don&#39;t breathe.

	Loc Rhod and Cornelius hold their breath.  Korben strikes the match.  A
small flame appears on the tip.  A breeze goes through the room.  Korben
feels like he&#39;s got TNT in his hands.  He approaches the flame to the Stone.
The flame twists, dims, flickers ...but holds on.  The Stone opens.  A patch
of miniature fire appears. Korben sighs, snuffs out the match.  The fourth
beam, a red one, immediately forms.

270	EXT.  SPACE

	A mass of fire fills the screen.  The Earth is only a thousand miles
away.

271	INT.  PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE

						SCIENTIST
					Two more minutes.

	The President shuts his eyes.  His lids move in prayer.

272	INT.  CHAPEL

	Korben helps Leeloo onto her feet where the four beams and four colors
crisscross.

						KORBEN
				It&#39;s up to you now, Angel!

						LEELOO
				I&#39;m so tired...

						KORBEN
				You can sleep tomorrow... come on...

						LEELOO
				I want to sleep... forever...

						KORBEN
				Leeloo! Listen to me! I&#39;ll take you on
				a vacation afterwards! A real vacation,
				this time, for as long as you want.
				Come on! You can do it!

	Korben slowly releases Leeloo and steps back from the altar.
	Leeloo can barely stand in the center of the four beams.
	An indistinct white beam begins to form around her, starts to rise.

						CORNELIUS
				Come on Leeloo! Come on!

	The beam loses its intensity.  Leeloo crumples to the floor.

273	EXT.  SPACE

	The Dark Planet hurtles toward Earth.  A hundred miles before impact.
The African continent is visible.  No doubt about it:	The fireball is
heading right for Egypt.

274	INT.  PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE

	Seconds tick away relentlessly on the scientist&#39;s stopwatch.

						SCIENTIST
				It&#39;ll be entering the atmosphere in one
				minute.

275	INT.  CHAPEL

	The heat in the temple is unbearable.  All the walls start to ooze the
same horrible black slimy liquid seen at Zorg&#39;s.  A drop of liquid falls to
the temple floor and begins to smoke, eating away at it like acid.  Loc
Rhod has to dodge another drop of the stuff.  Korben quickly straightens
Leeloo up and puts her back in the center of the beams.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo! If you don&#39;t get on with the
				program we&#39;re all gonna die! And that&#39;s
				not on my agenda for today.

	Leeloo wraps her arms around Korben&#39;s neck.

						LEELOO
					(weak)
				What&#39;s the use of saving lives...
				when you see what you do with them!

						KORBEN
				You&#39;re right but there are lots of good
				things... beautiful things...

						LEELOO
				...Like love...

						KORBEN
				Exactly.

						LEELOO
				But I don&#39;t know love... I&#39;m like a machine
				programmed to save other people&#39;s lives but
				never to have one of my own.

276	INT.  PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE

	The Scientist&#39;s stopwatch goes from 30 to 29 seconds.

277	INT.  CHAPEL

						LEELOO
				I have thousands of memories but none
				of them are mine... There is no need for
				me other than this. I&#39;m immortal but I have
				no life.

						KORBEN
				Yes, you do! I need you. More than you
				can imagine! Stand up straight!

						LEELOO
				Why?... Why would you need me?

						KORBEN
				Because...

						CORNELIUS
					(to himself)
				Tell her, for God&#39;s sake!

	A bit of the black acid falls on Loc Rhod&#39;s shirt setting it on fire.  He
rips if off.

	CUT TO:

278	INT.  CHAPEL

						KORBEN
				Because...

	Leeloo has tears in her eyes.  The heat is overpowering.  Black acid is
everywhere.

						LEELOO
				Tell me...

						KORBEN
				I love you...

	Despite her fatigue, Leeloo smiles broadly.

	CUT TO:

278b	INT.  PRESIDENT&#39;S  OFFICE

	The stopwatch goes from 3 to 2.

279 INT.  CHAPEL

						LEELOO
				Now you&#39;re allowed to kiss me.

	- Korben wraps his arms around her and kisses her like he&#39;s never kissed
anybody before.  - The white beam, the Divine Light, immediately forms
around Leeloo and Korben. - The stopwatch hits zero.  - The Absolute Beam
explodes from the top of the pyramid and heads straight into the sky zapping
the fireball smack in the middle, slowing it down.  - Korben and Leeloo kiss
like there was no tomorrow.

	- The beam hardens and slowly solidifies the Evil Planet.  Inaudible
screeches escape from the dying planet.  Screeches of terrifying pain as if a
million souls were dying.

	- Streams of black acid spurt from the pyramid and solidify like
brilliant stalactites.

280	EXT.  SPACE

	The pure beam, the Light of Life, has finished its work.  The Dark Planet
nothing more than a dead planet.
	Strangely enough, it looks like the moon.  Everything is calm around it.

281	INT.  PRESIDENT&#39;S OFFICE

	President Lindberg opens his eyes and realizes he&#39;s not dead-

						SCIENTIST
				The planet seems to have stopped at...
				62 miles from impact.

282	INT.  CHAPEL

	In the temple, the beam loses its intensity.  But Leeloo and Korben
remain stuck together, lost in their kiss.  Cornelius has dropped to his
knees, clutching his hands.

	Loc Rhod slips along the wall with a sigh.  He gives Cornelius a knowing
smile.

						LOC RHOD
				This guy is a killer with the babes.
				I knew it from the moment I laid eyes
				on him.

	Cornelius and Loc Rhod burst out laughing.  Korben and Leeloo keep on
kissing.

283	INT.  LABORATORY

	We are in the Nucleological Laboratory that gave birth to Leeloo in the
beginning of our story.  The President enters the lab followed by a group
of officials in ceremonial dress.

						MUNRO
				Mr. President, let me introduce you to
				Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.

						MACTILBURGH
				It&#39;s an honor to receive you. Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
					(beaming)
				Yes.. Well? Where are our two heroes?

						MACTILBURGH
				They were so tired from their ordeal that
				we put them in the reactor this morning..

						PRESIDENT
				I have 19 more meetings after this one
				Professor..

						PROFESSOR
				Of course.. Let me see if they&#39;re revived.

						AIDE
				We go live in one minute, Mr. President.

	Mactilburgh goes to the reactor and opens a small slot which allows him
to see what is going on under the blue shield.

	Leeloo and Korben are naked, arms wrapped around each other, kissing and
probably engaged in hoppi hoppa.
	Mactilburgh looks troubled.

						MACTILBURGH
				I.. uh.. they need five more minutes,
				Mr. President.

	The President, pressed for time, looks over to his aide who in struggling
with a phone call.

						AIDE
				No ma&#39;am... I tried... No ma&#39;am...

						PRESIDENT
				Who is it?

						AIDE
				Some woman... claims she&#39;s Korben&#39;s
				mother...

						PRESIDENT
				Give it here...

	The President takes the phone and goes to the window.

						PRESIDENT
				Mrs. Dallas, this in the President.
				On behalf of the entire Federation,
				I would like to thank...

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				Don&#39;t pull that crap with me, Finger...
				I&#39;d recognize that trash can voice of
				yours in a dark alley during a rain storm.
				You tell that worthless no account son
				of mine he should plotz for the way he&#39;s
				ignored his mother... when I think of all I
				sacrificed for him...

284	EXT.  NEW YORK

	Outside the lab we see the President through the window, holding the
phone away from his ear.

	PAN slowly across Manhattan.
	Credits Roll as TWO full rising silver moons ascend in the dark blue sky.

     INT.  MIAMI AIRPORT, TERMINAL -- DAY

     Amongst the weary tourist families and solitary businessmen
     sits TOM WELLES, middle-aged, hair neat, suit crisp and
     gray.  He&#39;s eating crackers from a cellophane package,
     sipping soda from a paper cup, watching an ARRIVAL GATE.

     AT THE GATE

     PASSENGERS arrive: the paunchy, graying men of First Class
     leading the pack, except for a handsome YOUNG REPUBLICAN
     poster boy hurrying along.

     ACROSS THE TERMINAL

     Welles gets up and FOLLOWS...

     EXT.  MIAMI AIRPORT, CURBSIDE -- DAY

     Welles comes outside, squinting in the sun, moving down the
     sidewalk, looking back over his shoulder...

     The Young Republican is lead to a waiting LIMO by a DRIVER.

     Welles moves to the nearby TAXI STAND...

     INT.  TAXI -- DAY

     Welles gets in, turning in his seat to watch behind.

                             CAB DRIVER
               Where to?

     Welles keeps watching, sees the limo pull away and pass.

                             WELLES
               Follow that limousine.  Don&#39;t get
               too close, don&#39;t let it get too far
               away.  Just keep with it.

                             CAB DRIVER
               You kidding?

                             WELLES
               Nope.

     The cab set in motion.  Welles takes out cigarettes,
     lighting one, takes out a small NOTEPAD and makes notations.

                             CAB DRIVER
               Uh, listen... you&#39;re not supposed to
               be smoking in here.  I&#39;m sorry,
               that&#39;s company policy...

                             WELLES
               How about this... every cigarette I
               smoke, I give you five dollars?

                             CAB DRIVER
               Okay... okay, yeah, that&#39;d be good...


     EXT.  MIAMI BEACH, &quot;GOLD COAST&quot; -- DAY

     In front of an Art Deco hotel, the driver opens the
     limousine door and the Young Republican steps out. 

     ACROSS THE STREET 

     Welles watches from inside the double-parked taxicab. 


     EXT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE -- DAY 

     Not exactly four-star.  &quot;&lt;b&gt;AD LT MOVIES EVERY ROOM.&lt;/b&gt;&quot; 

     INT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE -- DAY

     Welles is asleep on the bed, full dressed, hands folded
     across his stomach, snoring lightly, sweaty. 

     INT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE, RESTAURANT -- DAY 

     Welles sits alone at the bar, eating a sandwich, bored.  He
     watches some fuzzy ESPN on the t.v., looks at his watch. 

     EXT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE -- DAY 

     Welles walks across the parking lot, gets into his RENTAL
     CAR, starts it and drives away. 


     EXT.  MIAMI BEACH DISCOTHEQUE -- NIGHT 

     Young Republican and a GAUDY WOMAN exit the disco, MUSIC
     THROBBING out from the doors behind them.  They join hands,
     drunk, heading to the street, looking for their limo. 

     DOWN THE STREET

     Welles is seated in his parked rental car, raises a CAMERA
     with TELEPHOTO LENS: whir, CLICK, whir, CLICK, whir, CLICK...
     Welles lowers the camera, letting out a yawn. 


     INT.  AIRPLANE, COACH -- NIGHT 

     The familiar DRONE of flight.  Welles is shoehorned into his
     aisle seat, using tiny utensils to eat his tiny meal.

     An OLDER WOMAN arrives in the aisle.  Welles picks up his
     tray, closes his tray table, unbuckling his seatbelt,
     struggling to get up... finally successful, balancing his
     tray, letting the woman in to the window seat. 

                             OLDER WOMAN 
                 Thank you. 

     Welles nods, forcing a smile, sitting back down.  He returns
     to toiling over his miniature supper. 


     EXT.  HARRISBURG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT 

     Welles&#39; AIRPLANE ROARS down with a SCREECH, landing lights
     gleaming.  The airport is small, relatively isolated.

     TITLE:      &lt;b&gt;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania&lt;/b&gt;

     INT.  HARRISBURG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT

     Passengers arrive.  Welles is with them, searching the few
     PEOPLE waiting in the terminal hallway.  Welles smiles...

     Welles&#39; wife, AMY, smiles when she sees him.  She&#39;s plain
     and pretty, holding one hand on a BABY STROLLER beside her.
     Welles comes to her, embracing her, appreciating her.

                             AMY
                 Welcome home.

                             WELLES
                 Do you know how much I missed you?

     They kiss, but Amy pulls away, sniffs him.

                             AMY 
                 What&#39;s this... have you been
                 smoking... ? 

                             WELLES 
                 Smoking?  I&#39;m not smoking. 

                             AMY 
                 Your clothing reeks of it. 

                             WELLES 
                 You know, Amy, I&#39;ve been sitting
                 around in bars and everywhere
                 following this guy... I mean, is
                 this what I get first thing?  Before
                 you even &quot;hello,&quot; you accuse me... ?

                             AMY 
                 I&#39;m not accusing you... 

                             WELLES 
                 Well, I&#39;m not smoking, okay? 

                             AMY 
                 Okay, I believe you. 

                             WELLES 
                 We&#39;ve been all through that.  I&#39;ve
                 been on my best behavior.

     Welles bends to the stroller, picks up his infant daughter,
     CINDY, and hoists her in the air, overjoyed. 

                             WELLES 
                 Hello, pumpkin-head, did you miss
                 me?  I sure missed you... 

     He kisses the happy child, holding her in one arm. 

                             WELLES 
                 Let&#39;s get my bags and get the hell
                 out of here. 

     Welles pulls Amy close and kisses her again, leads the way.
     Amy follows, pushing the stroller. 

                             AMY 
                 How&#39;s the detective business?

                             WELLES 
                 Business was fine.  I&#39;ll tell you
                 what, you couldn&#39;t pay me enough to
                 live down there. 

                             AMY 
                 You better not be smoking, that&#39;s
                 all I can say. 

                             WELLES 
                 Honey, I&#39;m not, please... 

     Amy takes Welles hand, smiling at him. 


     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles and Amy make love in the darkness.  Standard,
     missionary position sex, little passion.  They slow to a
     finish, uneventfully, holding each other.  Their breathing
     quiets.  Their daughter CINDY can be HEARD CRYING elsewhere.

     Welles kisses his wife again, rolls off of her and sits on
     the edge of the bed.  Amy covers herself. 

                             AMY
                 I love you.

                             WELLES
                 I love you. 

     He looks towards her in the dark.  He gets up, gets a towel
     from the bathroom and wraps it around him. 

     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, BABY&#39;S ROOM -- NIGHT 

     Cindy&#39;s crying.  Welles enters, goes to lean into the crib.

                             WELLES 
                 What&#39;s all the trouble, Cinderella?
                 What are you crying about, huh? 

     He lifts and cradles Cindy, comforting her. 


     EXT.  HARRISBURG CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING --DAY 

     A small city of moderate architecture facing the Susquehanna.

     INT.  OFFICE -- DAY 

     An old money office with windows over the river.  A well-to-
     do POLITICIAN looks unhappily through PHOTOS on his desk.
     Welles sits by the Pennsylvania state flag, watching.

     PHOTOS show the Young Republican and Gaudy Woman in Miami:
     leaving the Art Deco hotel, the Discotheque, a restaurant...

                             WELLES 
                 Your son-in-law dealt with the dry
                 cleaning franchise during the day,
                 saw that woman every night. 
                       (clears his throat) 
                 The specifics are in the report, and
                 information about the woman.  It&#39;s
                 unpleasant, I know.  I apologize... 

                             POLITICIAN 
                 None too discreet, is he? 

                             WELLES 
                 No, sir, he is not. 

                             POLITICIAN 
                 He&#39;s an imbecile.  I tried to warn
                 my daughter, but what can you do? 

     The politician shakes his head in disgust.  Welles rises. 

                             WELLES 
                 The um... you&#39;ll find my invoice in
                 the envelope. If that&#39;s all...

                             POLITICIAN 
                 Yes, Mister Welles, thank you. 

                             WELLES 
                 Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever
                 be of further assistance.

     Welles leaves, glances back, shuts the door. 

     EXT.  HARRISBURG STREETS -- DAY 

     Welles drives his plain Ford past the CAPITAL BUILDING. 

     EXT.  HARRISBURG, BRIDGE -- DAY 

     Welles&#39; car crosses the Susquehanna, leaving the city. 

     EXT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, BACKYARD -- DAY 

     Sunny day.  Welles wears tan khakis, T-shirt and fishing
     cap, mowing his lawn with his ROARING lawnmower.  Welles&#39;
     yard is modest, surrounding his modest split level suburban
     one in a neighborhood of similar homes and similar yards.

     Welles turns the lawnmower, stopping to mop his brow.  One
     of his neighbors is repainting a back porch.  The neighbor
     waves.  Welles waves, resumes mowing. 


     INT.  BOWLING ALLEY -- NIGHT

     MUSIC&#39;S LOUD.  League Night.  Every lane full.  Welles is
     with his team in BOWLING SHIRTS.  Welles hoists his ball,
     preparing to bowl.  He takes three steps, releases...

     Down the lane, PINS SCATTER.  One pin remains standing.

     Welles balls up his fists and curses, walks back towards his
     rowdy, mocking teammates.  He shouts back at them, laughing,
     grabbing his beer and drinking, waiting at the ball return. 

     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT 

     Dinner.  Welles and Amy eat at the kitchen table with Cindy
     in a high chair.  Amy feeds Cindy between bites.  Welles is
     still in his league shirt. 

                             AMY 
                 You think you&#39;ll have time for the
                 water heater this weekend?

                             WELLES 
                 Sure.  I&#39;ll call the guy. 

                             AMY 
                 You&#39;re not using the same guy who
                 tried to fix it? 

                             WELLES 
                 I&#39;m not using him again for
                 anything.  He was worthless. 
                       (eating)
                 You have bridge here Saturday? 

                             AMY 
                 Betty&#39;s out of town so we&#39;re playing
                 next week. 

     Welles nods, eating.  He watches Amy feed Cindy.  The PHONE
     starts RINGING.  Welles goes to answer it. 

                             WELLES 
                       (into PHONE) 
                 Hello.  Yes... could you hold on a
                 minute...?

     Welles hands the phone to Amy, pats Cindy&#39;s head as he heads
     downstairs, through the LIVING ROOM... 

     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Welles enters his well kept OFFICE, turns on a light at the
     desk.  The room is filled with FILE CABINETS and shelves of
     BOOKS, hundreds of PHONE BOOKS and a COPY MACHINE.  Welles
     picks up the phone and cups the receiver. 

                             WELLES 
                       (shouts upstairs)
                 Okay, I&#39;ve got it.
                       (into phone)
                 Hello... sorry, I was switching
                 phones.  It&#39;s a pleasure to make
                 your acquaintance, Mrs. Christian.
                       (listens)
                 Yes.  Yes, I understand... tomorrow
                 evening should be fine...

     Welles listens, clears space on his desk, taking notes. 


     EXT.  CHRISTIAN COMPOUND -- DUSK 

     A huge OLD WORLD MANSION is situated at the center of acres
     of Pennsylvania forest and vast gardens.  Welles&#39; car heads
     down a long tree lined drive, to the dark mansion. 

     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT 

     Welles follows a BUTLER down a long hall. 

     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, LIBRARY -- NIGHT 

     The butler shows Welles in, shuts the door.
     Towering SHELVES of BOOKS are serviced by ladders.  Far
     across the room, an old, sad woman, MRS. CHRISTIAN, sits
     waiting with a tall, thin, sinister ghoul of a LAWYER.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Mister Welles. You&#39;re very prompt.   

                             WELLES 
                 I try to be.

     Welles crosses towards them. It takes a while. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I appreciate your coming on such
                 short notice. 

     Mrs. Christian holds out her hand and Welles takes it. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 This is Mister Longdale, my late
                 husband&#39;s attorney. 

     Welles shakes Longdale&#39;s limp hand, looking him over. 

                             WELLES 
                 Uh huh, pleasure. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Apparently Mr. Longdale has
                 something he feels he simply must
                 say before you and I speak.

                             LONGDALE 
                 Yes, I do have something to say.  I
                 insisted on being here as soon as I
                 heard Mrs. Christian contacted you. 

                             WELLES 
                 I&#39;m listening. 

                             LONGDALE 
                 As Mr. Christian&#39;s attorney and one
                 of the executors of his estate, it
                 concerns me that a meeting of this
                 sort should take place without my
                 being asked to attend. 

                             WELLES
                 Of what sort? 

                             LONGDALE
                 You are a private investigator? 

                             WELLES 
                 That&#39;s right. 

                             LONGDALE 
                 Well, whatever reasons Mrs.
                 Christian has for engaging the
                 services of a private investigator,
                 I should certainly be a party to.
                 But, since she feels differently, I
                 can only go on the record as having
                 expressed my adamant disapproval. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Yes, how theatrical.  So you&#39;ve gone
                 on the record, and now perhaps you
                 should just be gone. 

     Longdale&#39;s irritated, but has no choice.  He walks away. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Have a pleasant evening. 
                       (to Welles) 
                 Will you have tea, Mister Welles? 

                             WELLES
                 Thank you. 

     Mrs. Christian begins pouring tea from the service on a
     table.  Welles watches Longdale exit. 

                             WELLES 
                 He&#39;s odd.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 He&#39;s a lawyer.
                       (offers tea)
                 Please, sit, here...

     Welles accepts a dainty tea cup and saucer, taking a seat.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I&#39;ve spoken to friends of mine and
                 my husband&#39;s, in Harrisburg, in
                 Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about
                 you.  I must say you have friends in
                 influential places. 

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;ve been privileged to provide
                 services for people I admire.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 You are highly recommended.  Praised
                 for your discretion... your strict
                 adherence to confidentiality. 

     Welles nods, sipping tea. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 As you know, my husband passed away
                 recently.  Two weeks ago now.

                             WELLES 
                 My condolences. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 His passing has left me with...
                 something of a dilemma.  A terrible,
                 terrible dilemma. 

                             WELLES 
                 I&#39;ll do whatever I can to help. 

     Mrs. Christian studies Welles.

     INT. CHRISTIAN HOUSE, MR CHRISTIAN&#39;S OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Mrs. Christian and Welles enter.  This office has been lived
     in for a lifetime.  Giant DESK.  AMERICAN FLAG.  Walls
     covered in old b+w PHOTOGRAPHS and ACHIEVEMENTS. A large,
     baked enamel sign nailed up, &quot;&lt;b&gt;CHRISTIAN STEEL.&lt;/b&gt;&quot; 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 His inner sanctum. 

     Welles looks up at the OIL PAINTING over the fireplace: MR.
     CHRISTIAN, a powerful, old man, posed with a dark, teeming,
     industrial landscape behind him. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Not many people have been inside
                 this room. 

     Welles examines PHOTOS of Mr. Christian visiting various
     STEEL PLANTS, COAL MINES and ground-breaking ceremonies,
     shaking hands with WORKMEN, with POLITICIANS. 


                             WELLES 
                 Pittsburgh? 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Mostly.  That&#39;s where he started his
                 empire building.
                       (looks up at portrait)
                 He was a good man.  Notorious as an
                 eccentric, but that was something he
                 cultivated.  He &lt;u&gt;wanted&lt;/u&gt; to be
                 legendary.

                             WELLES 
                 He succeeded. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 We were married forty-five years.
                 Hard even for me to imagine.  We had
                 our troubles.  There were plenty of
                 places for him to be other than
                 here, but he was always loyal to me,
                 and I to him.  I loved him deeply.

     Welles waits. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles? 

                             WELLES 
                 I wear a gun when I can tell a
                 client expects me to.  Other than
                 that, there&#39;s never any reason. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Just curious. 

     Mrs. Christian crosses to take down a PICTURE, revealing a
     WALL SAFE.  The safe is ajar, burnt and scarred, broken into.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 My husband was the only one with the
                 combination to this safe.  I knew
                 about it, but as far as I was
                 concerned it was none of my
                 business.  Not till now, that is. 

                             WELLES 
                 You hired someone to open it.  I&#39;ll
                 bet the lawyer loved that.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 There was nothing he could do.  My
                 husband left everything to me.
                       (looks at safe)
                 I prevented anyone from seeing the
                 contents.  I felt these were my
                 husband&#39;s private things.  I
                 didn&#39;t... I didn&#39;t realize... 

                             WELLES 
                 Do you want to tell me what you
                 found? 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Cash, stock certificates, and this...

     She takes something from her pocket, puts it on the desk: a
     plastic bag containing a short 8MM FILM on a plastic reel.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 It&#39;s a film... of a girl being
                 murdered. 

                             WELLES 
                 I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t... 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 This is a movie showing a girl being
                 murdered.  She&#39;s sitting on a bed,
                 and a man rapes her... and he begins
                 to cut her with a knife...
                       (pause)
                 I only watched what I could.

     Welles picks up the film, looks at it. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I didn&#39;t know what to think.  I
                 can&#39;t tell you how horrible it&#39;s
                 been, to know this belonged to my
                 husband.  To know that he watched
                 this... this atrocity.  But, I can&#39;t
                 go to the police...

                             WELLES
                 Mrs. Christian... please, will you
                 sit down a moment? 
                       (leads her to a chair) 
                 I want you to listen carefully.
                 What you&#39;re talking about is a
                 &quot;snuff film.&quot;  But, from what I
                 know, snuff films are a kind of...
                 urban myth.  Like, red light
                 district folklore.  There&#39;s no such
                 thing, I can assure you. 

     Mrs. Christian shakes her head. 

                             WELLES 
                 Please, believe me.  This is
                 probably a stag film.  Simulated
                 rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might
                 seem real, but there are ways of
                 making it look realistic... fake
                 blood and special effects...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 No. 

                             WELLES 
                 If you were to study it you&#39;d see
                 the camera cutting away... you&#39;d see
                 the tricks they can play...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I&#39;m telling you it&#39;s not that. 

                             WELLES 
                 I&#39;m sure it is. 
                       (smiles) 
                 It&#39;s probably something your husband
                 was given as a bad joke.  More than
                 likely he never even watched it. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Will you watch it and see for
                 yourself? 

                             WELLES 
                 Of course.  But, I&#39;m certain it&#39;s
                 nothing to worry about. 


     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT 

     An 8MM PROJECTOR faces a wall.  Welles looks back to Mrs.
     Christian in the doorway.  Mrs. Christian leaves, shuts the
     door.  Darkness.  Welles turns on the projector and sits.
     The PROJECTOR CLATTERS, shooting bright images...

     ON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, over exposure, then... the grainy
     FILM is HAND HELD, constantly in motion, showing a skinny
     GIRL, 16 or 17, in a negligee, sitting on a bed in a
     nondescript room with little furniture.  Looks like a hotel
     room.  We only ever see three walls.  The once beautiful
     girl looks worn, drugged, dark circles under her eyes,
     staring blankly.  The CAMERA&#39;S tungsten SPOTLIGHT casts
     long, shifting shadows as the camera moves, but the girl
     still stares oblivious.  The bed is wrapped in PLASTIC and
     DUCT TAPE.  The floor is covered by PLASTIC SHEETING...

     Welles watches, crossing his arms, already uncomfortable.

     ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a
     bathroom, and a MASKED MAN enters.

     The Masked Man wears a garish, Mexican WRESTLING MASK with
     eye holes and a mouth.  The mask covers his entire head.
     He&#39;s naked except for red shorts, his body scrawny, oiled,
     pale.  The man goes to stand in front of the girl.  He seems
     to be saying something to her, but the film is silent and
     the ONLY SOUND is the PROJECTOR&#39;S LOUD sprocket hole
     CLATTER.  It&#39;s all one long take.  The CAMERA MOVES to favor
     the girl...

     Welles sits straight in his chair, wary.

     ON THE WALL: Masked Man raises his open hand and SLAPS the
     girl, knocking her back on the bed...

     Welles grimaces.

     ON THE WALL: Masked Man pulls the girl back to a seated
     position.  The girl&#39;s like a rag doll, face reddened, eyes
     closed, but she remains upright.  Masked Man uses his thumbs
     to open her unseeing eyes.  He touches her mouth with his
     fingers, presses his lips to hers.  Then, Masked Man backs
     away, leaving frame, till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked
     Man standing at a table with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid
     out.  Masked Man runs his fingers over the blades...

     Welles rises slowly, still watching.

     ON THE WALL: Masked Man selects a huge Bowie knife and moves
     back towards the girl...

     Welles crosses his arms tight, disbelieving, fearful.
     &lt;u&gt;WE WILL NEVER SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN THE FILM&lt;/u&gt;, but Welles
     does.  In the flickering, reflected light, Welles backs
     involuntarily away from the horrible images, holding his
     fist to his mouth, breathing hard.

     Welles keeps backing away, till he&#39;s backed against a wall.
     The PROJECTOR&#39;S CLATTERING.  Welles is sickened, sweating,
     still watching, till he finally shuts his eyes.

     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, ADJOINING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Silence.  Mrs. Christian sits waiting, troubled.
     The door to the dining room opens and Welles enters from the
     dark, visibly shaken.  Mrs. Christian watches him, her
     sorrow now shared.

                             WELLES
                 You... you need to go to the police. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I told you I can&#39;t, not yet. 

                             WELLES
                 You don&#39;t have any other choice. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                       (stands, shakes her head) 
                 No.  For me to live with the ruin of
                 my husband&#39;s name, I need know that
                 whoever did this will be punished.
                 If you can find them, I will take
                 their names to the police.  I&#39;ll say
                 my husband confessed on his death
                 bed. I&#39;ll say I didn&#39;t have courage
                 to come forward at first...

                             WELLES 
                 It won&#39;t work like that.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 Any evidence you collect can be
                 given to the police later,
                 anonymously.  I&#39;ve thought about it
                 and there&#39;s no other way.  If you
                 can&#39;t find them... if the only thing
                 that comes from this film is that
                 this is all my husband will be
                 remembered for, well I can&#39;t let
                 that happen.  I&#39;m telling you I
                 won&#39;t.  If there&#39;s no chance that
                 poor girl&#39;s memory can be served,
                 then I&#39;ll just have to spend my last
                 days trying to forget her. 

     Welles sits, rests his head in his hands. 

                             WELLES 
                 I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate
                 investigations...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 You&#39;ve found missing persons before. 

                             WELLES 
                 Nothing remotely like this. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN 
                 I know what I&#39;m asking.  Your
                 compensation will be appropriate to
                 the risk.  You&#39;ll need cash to buy
                 information, and I&#39;ll provide it.
                       (pause)
                 I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.
                       (pause)
                 You saw what he did to her.

     Welles stands, torn apart and uncertain, looks back to the
     dining room where the projector sits idle.


     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, BABY&#39;S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Cindy is sound asleep in her crib.
     Welles is seated near, staring at his sleeping child.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles digs in piles of SHOEBOXES and BOOKS on the floor of
     his cluttered closet, finds what he wants: a LOCK BOX.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Welles twists the lock box dial&#39;s combination, opens the box
     to reveal his GUN, HOLSTER and CLEANING SUPPLIES.  Welles
     takes out the gun, cleaning it.  Amy watches.

                             WELLES 
                 This is the mortgage.  This is
                 Cindy&#39;s college money. 

                             AMY
                 I understand.

                             WELLES 
                 Sometimes you can&#39;t know what I&#39;m
                 doing.  It&#39;s better that way.

                             AMY
                 I know.

                             WELLES 
                 It&#39;s a missing persons case... a
                 long shot.  I&#39;ll give it two months,
                 two months at most, then I&#39;ll be
                 back.  We&#39;ll take a vacation.

                             AMY
                 Why the gun? 

                             WELLES 
                 I&#39;m not gonna need it.  I won&#39;t even
                 wear it.  It&#39;s a precaution.
                       (cleaning gun)
                 Don&#39;t worry about me.


     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Welles looks through one file cabinet.  He pulls out a FILE.
     It contains all sorts of POLICE ARTIST SKETCHES.  Welles
     finds one of a TEENAGE GIRL with dark hair, looks at it.

     Welles positions the sketch on his COPY MACHINE, hits copy.

     EXT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, DRIVEWAY -- MORNING

     Welles loads BOXES and a SUITCASE into his car&#39;s back seat.

     Welles puts the lock box in the car&#39;s trunk, in a hiding
     place beside the spare tire.  He places a brown BRIEFCASE on
     top, covers them both with carpet.  He closes the trunk.

     EXT.  PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE -- MORNING 

     Little traffic.  Welles&#39; Ford races down the highway.


     EXT.  CLEVELAND CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY

     City skyline, overcast.  Looks like rain.

     TITLE:       &lt;b&gt;Cleveland, Ohio&lt;/b&gt;

     EXT.  CLEVELAND STREETS -- DAY

     Welles&#39; car moves slowly in a not-so-great neighborhood.
     Welles leans forward, peering through the windshield...

     An APARTMENT BUILDING&#39;S crooked SIGN lists &quot;&lt;b&gt;WEEKLY RATES.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

     INT.  WELLES&#39; ROOM, CLEVELAND -- DAY

     Dingy room.  Welles locks the door, puts the chain on. His
     suitcase and boxes are on the bed.  He begins unpacking,
     taking a PHOTO ENLARGER from one box and an 8MM PROJECTOR.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; ROOM, BATHROOM -- DAY

     The developer&#39;s on the toilet.  DEVELOPING PANS are on the
     floor, developer bath, stop bath and fixing bath, with
     BOTTLES of CHEMICALS and packages of PHOTO PAPER.  Welles
     uses tape and ALUMINUM FOIL to black-out a window.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; ROOM -- DAY

     Pizza box on the bedside table.  Welles&#39; suits hang in the
     closet.  Welles sits facing a small REEL TO REEL on a desk.
     He wears white gloves, handles the 8MM FILM, careful to hold
     it by the edges, holding it up to the light, squinting.

     Welles puts in a magnifying EYEPIECE, leaning close...

     WELLES&#39; P.O.V. THROUGH MAGNIFYING LENS: studying the first
     few inches of exposed film, coming upon TINY LETTERS printed
     just below the sprocket holes: &quot;&lt;b&gt;SUPRAlux 544.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;
 
     INT.  WELLES&#39; ROOM, BATHROOM -- DAY

     RED BULB in the light socket.  Welles threads the 8MM FILM
     into his enlarger, still in white gloves.

     He flicks the enlarger on, projecting a sideways IMAGE down
     onto the enlarger&#39;s baseboard, FOCUSING... it&#39;s the girl
     sitting on the bed, early in the snuff film.

     Welles makes an adjustment to the enlarger&#39;s lens; framing
     tighter on the girl&#39;s face, REFOCUSING.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles comes out of the makeshift darkroom, holding a PHOTO
     of the girl.  He props the photo up on a dresser, stands
     looking at it.  Sad girl, staring forward.

     Welles goes to pick up his CELLULAR PHONE, dials.

                             WELLES 
                       (into phone) 
                 Hello, honey, it&#39;s me.
                       (listens)
                 I&#39;m fine, how are you?

     Welles listens.  He turns to look at the girl&#39;s photo.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE -- DAY

     Nondescript.  &quot;&lt;b&gt;U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, OFFICES -- DAY 

     Small.  Cubicles.  Employees work phones and computers.
     BULLETIN BOARDS are covered in FAMILY PHOTOS, Polaroids and
     familiar &quot;HAVE YOU SEEN ME?&quot; missing person/children POSTERS.

     IN ONE CUBICLE, Welles opens his billfold, shows his
     identification: a laminated &quot;&lt;b&gt;LICENSED INVESTIGATOR,&lt;/b&gt;
     &lt;b&gt;Commonwealth of Pennsylvania&lt;/b&gt;&quot;, with WELLES&#39; PHOTO...

     The DIRECTOR of the center, a tired looking official in
     bifocals, studies the card.  Welles sits.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?

                             WELLES 
                 Call me Tom.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Alright, Tom.

                             WELLES
                 What I&#39;d like, very simply, is
                 access to your archive.  And, now I
                 understand this isn&#39;t something you
                 normally do for private citizens...

                             DIRECTOR 
                 There are reasons for the way we do
                 things here.

                             WELLES 
                 Absolutely.  Of course I&#39;ll abide by
                 whatever decision you make, but I&#39;d
                 appreciate if you&#39;ll hear me out... 

     The director sits back in his chair.

                             WELLES 
                 Few days ago, I was contacted by a
                 couple living in Philadelphia, a
                 doctor and his wife.  What happened
                 was they picked up a young girl
                 hitchhiking off 81, which heads into
                 Philadelphia, started up a
                 conversation with this girl, she
                 looked homeless, seemed about
                 eighteen maybe.  They convinced her
                 to let them buy her a meal in the
                 city.  Nice kid, mature, didn&#39;t have
                 much to say, but they got a sense
                 she&#39;s a runaway, so all through
                 dinner the doctor&#39;s working on her,
                 trying to convince her that at the
                 very least she should pick up a
                 telephone.  Not surprisingly, she
                 ate her food, excused herself...
                       (snaps fingers)
                 That&#39;s the last they saw her.  The
                 reason they came to me for help, the
                 reason I&#39;m coming to you, is we had
                 a friend of mine in the department
                 work up a sketch...
                       (shows the POLICE ARTIST
                        SKETCH he photocopied)
                 They want to see if I can I.D. this
                 girl, somehow pass along a message
                 to let the parents know the kid&#39;s
                 alive, doing alright.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or
                 N.C.M.E.C.? 

                             WELLES 
                 I figured you share information. 

                             DIRECTOR 
                 We do. 

                             WELLES 
                 For whatever reasons I thought you
                 might be more receptive.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Why don&#39;t they come to me? 

                             WELLES 
                 This doctor and wife, they&#39;re nice
                 people, but they don&#39;t want to get
                 too involved.  They&#39;re not trying to
                 have the parents come looking for
                 the girl either. 
                 You and I both know sometimes, not
                 often, but sometimes there&#39;s real
                 reasons why a kid&#39;ll run. 
                 Molestation, whatever.  Besides
                 that, the girl&#39;s probably eighteen,
                 so she&#39;s legal.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 I&#39;m not so sure about this. 

                             WELLES 
                 They&#39;re putting themselves in place
                 of this kid&#39;s parents and thinking
                 they&#39;d want to hear their girl&#39;s
                 okay, even if that&#39;s all they hear. 

                             DIRECTOR
                 I can give you my card, if your
                 clients want to call me... 

     Welles accepts a CARD, disappointed.

                             WELLES 
                 They were pretty clear they didn&#39;t
                 want this coming back on them.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Well, that&#39;s all I can do.  Sorry. 

     Welles looks at the director, stands, hangs his head.

                             WELLES 
                 Who knows... maybe she&#39;s already
                 given her parents a call, right?

     Welles leaves. 

     EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE -- DAY

     Welles comes out the front doors, pissed.

                             WELLES 
                 Fuck.

     He tears the card in half and drops it as he heads for his
     car.  After a moment, the director comes out after him...

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Excuse me... Tom, hold on...

     Welles looks back, walks back, glances down...
     makes sure he stands on the torn card, hiding it underfoot.

                             DIRECTOR
                 Listen, maybe I can help after all.
                 Why don&#39;t you come on back in...
                 we&#39;ll see what we can do. 

     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY

     Director leads Welles into this RESEARCH ROOM, a small
     library with long tables, old COMPUTERS, lots of FILE
     CABINETS and CARD CATALOGS.  Secretaries tend to the files.

                             DIRECTOR 
                 This is it.  It&#39;s not much. 
                       (points at computers) 
                 We&#39;ve got less than five percent on
                 computer and we lose that funding in
                 December.  I&#39;ll have someone show it
                 to you anyway.  Other than that, I&#39;m
                 afraid it&#39;s the wet thumb method.

     Welles looks to the many, many file drawers. 

                             DIRECTOR 
                 Files are mostly by state and year
                 of disappearance.  We try to keep
                 the children and adults separate.
                 No eating or smoking in here, but
                 there&#39;s a coffee machine in the hall.

                             WELLES 
                 Any good?

                             DIRECTOR
                 It&#39;s horrible, but it&#39;ll be your
                 best friend after a few days.  I
                 hope you realize what kind of long
                 shot you&#39;re chasing after. 

                             WELLES
                 You&#39;re gonna be seeing a lot of me.
                 You&#39;re sure you don&#39;t mind?

                             DIRECTOR 
                 It&#39;s good what you&#39;re doing.

     The director puts out his hand.  Welles looks, shakes.


     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     ON A COMPUTER SCREEN: files open and close -- PICTURE after
     PICTURE of a MISSING CHILDREN, mostly teenagers, each with
     physical description, age, date of disappearance, etc.  Lost
     souls, although these are posed portraits, high school
     yearbook photos and vacation photos, so the children are
     mostly smiling, happy and healthy. But, all &quot;&lt;b&gt;MISSING.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

     Welles works the computer keyboard and mouse...

     ON THE SCREEN: the FACES of TEENAGERS, boys and girls, one
     after the other, MISSING... MISSING... MISSING...


     INT.  CLEVELAND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles searches the SHELVES of the LIBRARY.  He begins
     taking down various books...

     &quot;&lt;b&gt;Motion Picture Photography.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;  &quot;&lt;b&gt;Film Stocks and Physical
     Characteristics.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;  &quot;&lt;b&gt;Super 8 Filmmaking.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

     INT.  CLEVELAND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- LATER -- MONTAGE

     In Welles&#39; notepad: &quot;&lt;b&gt;SUPRAlux 544.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;
     Welles sits paging through technical photography books. 


     INT. WELLES&#39; ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles has the 8MM FILM threaded through the projector.  He
     turns the CLATTERING projector on and sits, watching.

     ON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, then... the skinny GIRL in a
     negligee, sitting on the bed.  The CAMERA&#39;S SPOTLIGHT casts
     long shadows.  The girl stares, oblivious...

     ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a
     bathroom, and the MASKED MAN enters, wearing the ghastly
     WRESTLING MASK.  The man goes to stand in front of the
     girl.  He seems to be saying something.  The FILM halts.

     Welles sits forward, hand on the projector.  He&#39;s seen
     something.  He PLAYS the FILM in REVERSE...

     ON THE WALL: the Masked Man walks backwards, away from the
     girl, backwards into the bathroom, door shutting...

     Welles stops the projector, not taking his eyes from the
     image.  He ADVANCES the film FRAME BY FRAME...

     FRAME BY FRAME... as the bathroom door opens, and the Masked
     Man enters... FRAME BY FRAME... as the Masked Man moves
     forward... door closing behind him... STOP...

     FREEZE FRAME: a THIRD MAN is reflected in the bathroom
     mirror.  Grainy and blurred, but he&#39;s in the room with the
     girl, standing there, captured in the mirror in this one
     brief instant just before the bathroom door closes.

     Welles walks to take a closer look, studying the almost
     ethereal image of the Third Man.


     EXT.  CLEVELAND STREET CORNER -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles is in a PHONE BOOTH, feeds many quarters into the
     phone, waiting, looking at his notepad. 

                             WELLES
                       (into PHONE) 
                 Hello, Mrs. Christian?  Tom Welles.
                 Here&#39;s where we stand.  I checked
                 the film stock and it&#39;s called Supra-
                 lux 544.  The company that made that
                 stock discontinued it in &#39;92...
                       (listens)
                 Yeah, about five or six years ago.
                 Anyway, do what you can to dig up
                 your husband&#39;s old financial
                 records, look for anything out of
                 the ordinary...

     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles is back at the computer, alone, drinking coffee.
     ON THE COMPUTER: endless PHOTOS of MISSING CHILDREN.
     The &lt;u&gt;PHONE CALL CONTINUES in VOICE OVER&lt;/u&gt;:

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 Nobody really uses eight millimeter
                 film anymore, so we can assume there
                 are reasons our guys did.  First,
                 they could develop it themselves if
                 they had any sort of expertise.
                 Obviously, this isn&#39;t the kind of
                 movie you can just drop off at the
                 one-hour photo...

     INT.  WELLES&#39; ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles just stands, staring at the PHOTO of the GIRL.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 Second, the film that went through
                 the camera is what we&#39;ve got.
                 There&#39;s no negative.  Unlike video,
                 it wasn&#39;t meant to be duplicated.
                 No reason for them to risk having
                 more than one copy of their murder
                 floating around...

     INT.  CLEVELAND BAR -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Local bar.  Welles sits drinking with the archive&#39;s
     director, talking, smiling at something the director said.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 There don&#39;t seen to be many
                 fingerprints on the film itself, but
                 I&#39;m going to have to be careful to
                 leave them intact...

     INT.  MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles is tired, unshaven.  He&#39;s moved on to the physical
     files, at one table, looking through HUNDREDS of MISSING
     PERSON BULLETINS.  Secretaries tend to other files. 

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 It&#39;s okay for yours and your
                 husbands fingerprints to be on the
                 film, but you&#39;ll have to use me as
                 a middleman if you go to the police.
                 That way I don&#39;t have to explain why
                 my prints are on it...

     INT.  WELLES&#39; ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles sits with the PROJECTOR ON, watching the film again.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 There were three men.  Two are
                 obvious; the man in the mask and the
                 man running the camera, but I caught
                 a glimpse of a third man in a
                 mirror.  It&#39;s nothing that can be
                 used for identification, but he was
                 there, watching...

     ON THE WALL: Masked Man touches the girl&#39;s mouth, presses
     his lips to hers.  Masked Man backs away, leaving frame,
     till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked Man standing at a table
     with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid out...

     Welles notices something, puts the projector on FREEZE FRAME.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 So, there were three.  They would
                 have kept it small, wouldn&#39;t have
                 let anyone in on it they didn&#39;t have
                 to.  That&#39;s all for now... except,
                 I feel I should tell you... with
                 this looking like it happened at
                 least five or six years ago...

     Welles walks to the frozen IMAGE on the wall.  It shows the
     Masked Man&#39;s hands in frame, fingering the blades.

                             WELLES (V.O., cont)
                 Well, it&#39;s not very likely we&#39;ll
                 ever find out who this girl was. 
                       (listens) 
                 I will, I&#39;ll keep trying. Goodbye.

     V.O. PHONE CALL ends with the SOUND of the PHONE HANGING UP.

     ON THE WALL: there&#39;s a DARK SPOT on Masked Man&#39;s hand, on
     the arch between his index finger and thumb.  Grainy and
     hard to make out, but looks like a small TATTOO.

     INT.  WELLES ROOM, BATHROOM -- NIGHT -- END MONTAGE

     Welles has the 8MM FILM threaded into his photo enlarger,
     projecting the IMAGE we just saw down onto the baseboard.

     He re-frames, CLOSER ON the masked Man&#39;s hand, REFOCUSING...
     the black spot is a little clearer, looks like a small STAR
     tattoo on the back of Masked Man&#39;s hand.

     INT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY

     Welles sits hunched over the card catalog, still unshaven,
     drinking coffee, flipping through smaller PICTURES of
     MISSING CHILDREN in one drawer, one by one by one...

     Welles rolls his neck.  He looks to see the archive&#39;s
     director in the doorway.  The director nods, leaving.
     Welles gets back to it, stooped over the catalog.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     TITLE CARD:      &lt;b&gt;three weeks later&lt;/b&gt;

     EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE -- DAY

     In the lot, Welles gets wearily from his car, smoking.  He
     tosses the cigarette, gets a Thermos off the front seat.

     INT.  MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY

     Welles pulls out a card catalog drawer labeled &quot;&lt;b&gt;North
     Carolina 1992,&lt;/b&gt;&quot; flipping through picture cards.  The FACES
     of TEENAGERS: a happy BOY with blue eyes... a red headed
     GIRL with freckles... a ruddy faced BOY... a pretty GIRL
     with a ribbon in her hair... a black GIRL in a pink dress...
     a blonde haired BOY with curly hair...

     Welles furrows his brow.

     He backtracks to the pretty GIRL with the ribbon in her hair.

     Welles sits straight.  He reaches into his pocket, hands
     shaking a little, takes out and unfolds the PHOTO he printed
     of the girl from the snuff film.  It&#39;s her.

     Welles compares the two pictures.  She&#39;s prettier in the
     card catalog photo, but it&#39;s her.

     Welles can&#39;t believe it, looks around.  Secretaries at other
     files don&#39;t even know he&#39;s there.  Welles pulls out his
     notepad, scribbling down INFORMATION off the card...

     Writing the girl&#39;s name: &quot;&lt;b&gt;Mary Anne Matthews.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;


     EXT.  INTERSTATE HIGHWAY -- NIGHT

     Welles, car races past, alone on the dark freeway.

     EXT.  FAYETTEVILLE CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY

     Another small city.  Blue skies above.

     TITLE:     &lt;b&gt;Fayetteville, North Carolina&lt;/b&gt;

     EXT.  PUBLIC LIBRARY -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY

     Suburban library.  Kids play hop-scotch in the parking lot.

     INT.  FAYETTEVILLE LIBRARY, MICROFICHE ROOM -- DAY

     Welles works the MICROFICHE MACHINE, scrolling through old
     issues of the LOCAL NEWSPAPER, finds an ARTICLE headlined
     &quot;&lt;b&gt;Search Continues for Local Teen.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

     There&#39;s a PICTURE of the GIRL, Mary Anne Mathews; the same
     picture Welles found in the Missing Person Archive.

     Welles reads the article, writing on a LEGAL PAD.

                                              TIME CUT:

     NEWSPRINT SCROLLS past on the MICROFICHE MACHINE, till...
     &quot;&lt;b&gt;No Leads in Girl&#39;s Disappearance.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;  Same picture.
     The date at the top: &quot;&lt;b&gt;July 12, 1992.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

                                              TIME CUT:

     NEWSPRINT BLURS past... stops on a page of &lt;b&gt;OBITUARIES.&lt;/b&gt;
     Top of the page: &quot;&lt;b&gt;September 4, 1993.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

     CLOSE ON: &quot;&lt;b&gt;Mathews, Robert Steven, 1948-1993.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;
     &quot;Dead in an apparent suicide, Robert Mathews was discovered
     yesterday morning in the basement of...&quot;


     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, FAYETTEVILLE SUBURB -- DAY

     A tree-lined street of poor, boxy homes.  Welles&#39; car parks
     in front of one HOUSE with a neglected lawn.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles, clean shaven, picks a CLIPBOARD with a file folder
     and his legal pad on it, thumbs pages.  He drums his
     fingers, opens the glove compartment, pulls out the car&#39;s
     registration, other papers and &quot;Jiffy-Lube&quot; service reports,
     uses them to pad the file.

     Welles takes a BOTTLE of COLOGNE from his pocket.  He
     considers it, opens the bottle, applies cologne to his neck.

     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- DAY

     Welles knocks, clipboard in hand.  A sad, middle-aged woman
     answers, MRS. MATHEWS, looking through the screen door.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Yes... ?

                             WELLES
                       (smiles)
                 Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name&#39;s
                 Thomas Jones, I&#39;m a state licensed
                 investigator...

     Welles holds up his identification only long enough for Mrs.
     Mathews to see it looks official.

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;ve been hired as an independent
                 contractor by the U.S. Resource
                 Center for Missing Persons as part
                 of an internal audit.  If you have
                 any time over the next few days, I&#39;d
                 like to make an appointment to ask
                 some questions about the
                 disappearance of your daughter.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I don&#39;t understand, who are... ?

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;m sorry, let me explain, the
                 R.C.M.P. is a support organization
                 and archive, not unlike the Center
                 for Missing and Exploited Children
                 in Washington.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve
                 dealt with them before?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Yes, but... 

                             WELLES 
                 These volunteer organizations are
                 sort of interconnected, functioning
                 hand in hand with law enforcement.
                 The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review
                 their investigations...
                       (holds up clipboard)
                 ... fact-check their records, see if
                 there&#39;s anything they missed,
                 anything they should be doing
                 different.  I&#39;m here for a few days,
                 before I head back up to Virginia.
                 These reports go to the Justice
                 Department eventually.  I spoke to
                 your F.B.I. contact a few days ago,
                 uh...

     Welles pretends to look for the name on a Jiffy Lube page...

                             WELLES 
                 What was the name... ? I&#39;ve got it
                 here somewhere...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Neil... Neil Cole.

                             WELLES
                       (pretends he found it)
                 Right, Agent Cole told me he&#39;d call
                 and let you know to expect me.  He
                 didn&#39;t call?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No.

                             WELLES
                       (looking on legal pad)
                 Well, I&#39;m following up on your
                 daughter, Mary, height; five four,
                 weight; hundred ten pounds, brown
                 eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24,
                 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A
                 runaway, that&#39;s how she&#39;s listed.
                 Is this information correct... ?

     Mrs. Mathews stares, nods.

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;m sorry, I know this isn&#39;t easy.
                 Is there a more convenient time... ?
                       (looks at watch)
                 Can I buy you lunch, would that be
                 alright?

     Mrs. Mathews looks him up and down.


     EXT.  DAIRY QUEEN RESTAURANT -- DAY

     Welles and Mrs. Mathews eat at a PICNIC TABLE on the patio.

                             WELLES
                 It&#39;s very important you don&#39;t let
                 this raise your expectations.  It&#39;s
                 not going to effect any ongoing
                 efforts.  All I&#39;m saying is, please
                 know, I&#39;m not here to create any
                 false hope.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 They hired you.  You&#39;re like, a
                 private detective?

                             WELLES
                 That&#39;s exactly what I am.

     Mrs. Mathews chews, staring off into the distance.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I didn&#39;t think there were private
                 detectives anymore, except on TV.

                             WELLES
                 You probably expect me to be wearing
                 a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking
                 whiskey, chasing women and getting
                 beaten up by guys with broken noses.
                 Want to know what it&#39;s really like? 
                 It&#39;s sitting in a car and staring at
                 a hotel window for three days
                 straight, pissing in a plastic
                 bottle, pardon me, because some guy
                 thinks his wife&#39;s cheating on him.
                 Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who
                 hired you, he has a hair-lip,
                 dandruff and crooked teeth, and you
                 could have told him the minute you
                 laid eyes on him his wife&#39;s
                 cheating, and you don&#39;t blame her.

     Mrs. Mathews smiles.

                             WELLES
                 It&#39;s refreshing to actually sit down
                 and meet someone face to face,
                 someone nice like you.

     Welles smiles.  Mrs. Mathews takes out a cigarette.  Welles
     lights her, joins her in smoking, refers to his clipboard.

                             WELLES
                 So, she didn&#39;t leave a note?  She
                 never gave any indication where she
                 might go, before she left?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No.

                             WELLES
                 She just seemed... depressed... ?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 She didn&#39;t seem herself.  For months
                 there never was any way to get her
                 to talk about it.  One night we went
                 to bed... the next morning she was
                 gone.  She took some clothes.

                             WELLES
                 What was she running from?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I don&#39;t know.

                             WELLES
                 If there&#39;s anything you feel
                 uncomfortable talking about, tell
                 me, but I have to ask.  Your
                 husband... he committed suicide?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Yes.

                             WELLES
                 September 4th, 1993.  About a year
                 after Mary disappeared.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 We were divorced by then.  Things
                 fell apart... he was living with a
                 friend...

                             WELLES
                 Why do you think he did it?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 It got to be too much for him.

                             WELLES
                 You have to forgive me, but in these
                 circumstances... with your
                 daughter...
                       (pause)
                 Were there any indications of... any
                 sort of abuse?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 There wasn&#39;t anything like that.
                 The police and the FBI people asked,
                 but there wasn&#39;t anything happened
                 like that, never.  My husband... his
                 heart broke when Mary left...

                             WELLES
                 I didn&#39;t mean to...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 You try going through what we did.
                 Bob couldn&#39;t take it, that&#39;s all.
                 Christ, there&#39;s times when it still
                 seems like I can&#39;t either.

                             WELLES
                 I had to ask.  I apologize.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No one knows what it&#39;s like.  You
                 can&#39;t even imagine how much it hurts. 

     Welles is miserable.  A few CUSTOMERS walk past, looking at
     Mrs. Mathews.  She tries not to notice then noticing.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 People remember me from the news.
                       (pause)
                 Can you drive me back now?

                             WELLES
                 Of course. 


     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, MARY&#39;S ROOM -- DAY

     Mrs. Mathews enters.  Welles follows. 

     This was the girl&#39;s room, exactly as she left it -- POSTERS
     of ACTORS on the wall, many STUFFED ANIMALS on the pink
     sheets of the carefully made bed.  Perfectly preserved.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 This is her room.

     Welles looks around, uncomfortable.
     Shelves have PICTURES of MARY with female friends, a
     collection of CERAMIC FIGURINES of CLOWNS and ANIMALS.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 The police made a wreck of it, but
                 I put it back exactly how it was.
                 Just how she likes it.

     Welles takes a few steps into the room, looks down at a DESK
     where there are SIX brightly wrapped GIFTS.

                             MRS MATHEWS

                 Those are for her birthday.  One for
                 every year she&#39;s missed.  They&#39;ll be
                 waiting for her when she comes back. 

     Welles is nearly overwhelmed by sadness, struggling to hide
     it.  He backs to the door, looks at his watch...

                             WELLES
                 I... I shouldn&#39;t take anymore of
                 your time.  Maybe we can finish
                 tomorrow.  I&#39;ll call tomorrow...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Okay.

     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- DAY

     Welles escapes to his car, climbing in.  He starts it up...

     IN THE CAR

     Welles drives, tears welling up in his eyes.  He has to pull
     over and park, wiping his tears, fighting for composure.


     INT.  WELLES&#39; ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles has unpacked.  He&#39;s on the bed, on his CELLULAR...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 You should be able to take a shower
                 and still have hot water left, honey.
                       (listens)
                 Call him back and tell him I said
                 so.  The goddamn thing&#39;s still under
                 warranty.
                       (listens)
                 I&#39;m okay.  It&#39;s hard here.  It&#39;s
                 hard.
                       (listens)
                 I&#39;ve got a lead I have to follow
                 through.  To be honest, I don&#39;t
                 think I&#39;m going to get very far.
                 I miss you.  I love you.


     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING

     Welles sits at the kitchen table.  Mrs. Mathews makes
     coffee.  The home&#39;s decor is cheap and flowery.

                             MRS MATHEWS 
                 We weren&#39;t religious.  We never
                 forced religion down her throat,
                 like I&#39;ve seen some parents do to
                 their kids.  We never made her go to
                 church.  But, after Mary was gone,
                 that&#39;s when I got religious.

     Mrs. Mathews brings two cups of coffee, sits.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Doesn&#39;t make much sense, does it?
                 When everything&#39;s happy, when life&#39;s
                 fine and you have every reason to
                 believe there&#39;s a God, you don&#39;t
                 bother.  Then, something horrible
                 happens... that&#39;s when you start
                 praying all the time.  That&#39;s when
                 you start going to church.

                             WELLES
                 We&#39;re all like that.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Are you religious?

                             WELLES
                 No.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 You should be.

     Mrs. Mathews drinks coffee, stares into the cup.

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;ve got what I need for my report.
                 There is... there is one thing that
                 bothers me though.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 What? 

                             WELLES
                 It&#39;s not really my place, but it&#39;s
                 not easy for me to set aside the
                 private detective part of me either.
                 See, I know a little about missing
                 persons.  When kids run, they almost
                 always leave a note.  It&#39;s guilt.
                 They want to say goodbye.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 There wasn&#39;t one.  The police looked.

                             WELLES
                 Do you think the police did a good
                 job?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I don&#39;t know.  I think so.

                             WELLES
                 It is possible... and I know this
                 isn&#39;t something you want to hear.
                 Your daughter may have tried to hide
                 a note where she thought you would
                 eventually find it, but where she
                 knew your husband would never find
                 it.  She might have wanted to tell
                 you something...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No.  You don&#39;t have any reason to
                 think that...

                             WELLES
                 If the police focused their search
                 in &lt;u&gt;her&lt;/u&gt; room, &lt;u&gt;her&lt;/u&gt; belongings, well
                 that&#39;d be only natural, but they may
                 have been looking in the wrong place.

     Mrs. Mathews is getting upset.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 How... how can you say that to me...?

                             WELLES
                 Will you let me look?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 My husband never laid a hand on her.
                 She would have told me... she would
                 have told me...

                             WELLES 
                 You&#39;re probably right, and I
                 probably won&#39;t find anything.
                 I don&#39;t have a right to ask this,
                 and you can kick me out of your
                 house if you want, but this is my
                 profession and there&#39;s a part of me
                 that can&#39;t let it go.  Police are
                 just as human as you or I.  They
                 could have missed something.  They
                 probably didn&#39;t.
                       (pause)
                 Wouldn&#39;t you rather know?

     Mrs. Mathews thinks about it, tortured, shakes her head sadly.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Go ahead and look if you want.  I
                 don&#39;t care what you do.

     Mrs. Mathews gets up and walks out of the room.


     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- SEARCH MONTAGE -- DAY

     -In MRS. MATHEWS&#39; BEDROOM, Welles looks through DRESSER
      drawers, methodically, replacing everything as it was...
      searches hat boxes and shoe boxes in a CLOSET... takes
      BOOKS off SHELVES, fanning the pages, shaking them out...

     -In a BATHROOM, Welles examines the contents of a MEDICINE
      CABINET, examining old prescription bottles... opens
      CABINETS under the sink...

     -In the LIVING ROOM, Mrs. Mathews sits slumped in a chair,
      staring at a soap opera on TELEVISION, a BOTTLE of scotch
      on TV tray beside her, drink in hand.

     -In the KITCHEN, Welles stands on a chair, searches high
      CABINETS... looks through low CABINETS, on his knees, pulls
      out pots and pans... fans the pages of COOK BOOKS...

     -Welles stands in the doorway of MARY&#39;S ROOM, just stares.
      He takes a few steps back into the HALLWAY, looks up at the
      ceiling.  There&#39;s an ATTIC DOOR there.  Welles reaches to
      the door&#39;s handle, opens it, unfolds the portable stairs...

      -In the small ATTIC, Welles uses a penlight FLASHLIGHT,
      crouched under the low ceiling, looking through dusty BOXES
      of PHOTOGRAPHS; old photos of a wedding, of grandparents...
      Welles moves to pull back dusty sheets, finds a large
      WICKER BASKET and broken BICYCLE underneath...

      Welles opens the basket, takes out BLANKETS and QUILTS
      in mothballs.  He finds a wide VELVET BOX, takes it out,
      opens its hinged lid to reveal a set of good SILVERWARE.
      He touches the tarnished silverware, lifts out the top tray.
      Underneath, resting on top of more silverware, is a DIARY.

      Welles opens the DIARY, finds written: &quot;&lt;b&gt;Mary Anne Mathews.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

      Welles turns pages.  The DIARY&#39;S about half-full of
      feminine, cursive handwriting.  After the last written
      page, a PAGE has been TORN OUT.  Welles fingers the ragged
      edge, flips through the blank pages till he comes to the
      very last page, a GOODBYE NOTE.  Welles sits and reads...

                             MARY&#39;S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (emotionless monotone)
                 &quot;Dear mom.  If you&#39;re reading this,
                 it means I called you from
                 Hollywood, California and told you
                 where to find my diary.  I don&#39;t
                 think I&#39;ll be able to tell you this
                 when I talk to you, so I&#39;m writing
                 it down here.  You know I haven&#39;t
                 been happy for a long, long time.
                 For a long time now dad&#39;s been doing
                 things I couldn&#39;t tell you.  He&#39;s
                 been touching me and it&#39;s getting
                 worse.  I can&#39;t stay anymore.  I
                 know you and I haven&#39;t always gotten
                 along sometimes, but please don&#39;t
                 blame yourself.  There isn&#39;t
                 anything you can do.  I&#39;m going to
                 make a whole new life in California.
                 Maybe someday you&#39;ll see me on TV or
                 in magazines.  Don&#39;t worry about me.
                 Love, Mary Anne.&quot;

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, HALLWAY OUTSIDE MARY&#39;S ROOM -- DAY

     Welles shuts the attic door, takes the DIARY from his
     pocket, hides it in his waistband at the small of his back.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles enters.  Mrs. Mathews looks up from the TV.

                             WELLES
                 You were right.
                       (pause)
                 I didn&#39;t find anything.  I&#39;m going
                 to run and get something to eat.
                 Are you hungry?

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Yes.


     INT.  COPY SHOP -- LATE DAY

     Welles uses a self-serve COPY MACHINE, flattening the DIARY
     on the glass, photocopying the DIARY as quickly as he can.


     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles sits picking at fast food in front of him.  Mrs.
     Mathews&#39; food isn&#39;t even unwrapped. 

     She&#39;s numb from her drink, watching a GAME SHOW, smoking. 

                             WELLES
                 Do you ever consider... do you
                 realize that Mary may never come
                 back?

     Mrs. Mathews looks to Welles, looks back at the TV.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 I think about it everyday.  But,
                 every time the phone rings... every
                 single time, I still think it&#39;s her.

                             WELLES
                 It&#39;s been six years.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 What am I supposed to do?  Forget
                 her?  Time heals all wounds, right?
                       (misery building)
                 She&#39;s all I think about, and I&#39;ve
                 learned to live with that.  But, you
                 want the truth... the real truth?
                 If I had a choice... if I had to
                 choose, between her being out there,
                 living a good life and being happy,
                 and me not knowing; never finding
                 out what happened to her...
                       (pause)
                 ... or her being dead and me
                 knowing...
                       (pause)
                 I&#39;d choose to know.

     Mrs. Mathews stares into the TV, wipes tears.
     Welles takes a deep breath and holds it.  He watches her a
     long moment, motionless.  Finally he stands, voice unsteady.

                             WELLES
                 Excuse me, I have to use your
                 bathroom.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, HALLWAY OUTSIDE MARY&#39;S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles comes to the attic door, quietly pulls it open.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, ATTIC -- NIGHT

     Welles uses his penlight, digs out the DIARY from the hiding
     place in his waistband, replaces it in the box of
     silverware, closes the box.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, MARY&#39;S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles enters, takes a PICTURE FRAME off one shelf, opens
     the back and takes out the PHOTO of MARY from inside.

     INT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Mrs. Mathews still gazes into the TV.  Welles passes the
     doorway, not looking in, heading to the front door, opening
     the door and walking out...

     Mrs. Mathews doesn&#39;t even notice, doesn&#39;t look up.

     EXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Welles crosses the front lawn, not looking back, heading to
     the street, getting into his car, starting his car, doing a
     U-turn, driving away down the street.


     EXT.  FAYETTEVILLE AIRPORT, LONG TERM PARKING -- MORNING

     Welles&#39; boxes of belongings are piled in the back seat of
     his car.  Welles covers them with a blanket, shuts the door.

     Welles opens the trunk of his car, pulls back the carpeting.
     He opens the brown BRIEFCASE.  The briefcase is full of
     CASH, about $10,000, twenties and fifties in bundles.

     Welles transfers half the money into a carry-on bag, shuts
     the briefcase, covers it, closes the trunk.


     INT.  AIRPLANE, COACH -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     The cabin&#39;s half-full, dark.  Passengers sleep.  Under the
     only illuminated reading light, Welles reads the PHOTOCOPIED
     DIARY.  MARY&#39;S VOICE is a again a flat monotone...

                             &lt;b&gt;MARY&#39;S VOICE&lt;/b&gt; (V.O.)
                       (as Welles reads)
                 &quot;Dear diary.  I have a big math test
                 tomorrow.  I have to get better
                 grades.  How come everybody does
                 better than me?  Kathy doesn&#39;t even
                 study and she gets B&#39;s.  Two boys
                 got in a fight after school today.
                 One boy knocked the other boy&#39;s
                 tooth out, at least that&#39;s what it
                 looked like.  His nose and mouth
                 were bleeding all over the place...&quot;

     INT.  HOLLYWOOD HOTEL -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles&#39; suitcase is open on the bed.  Welles sits in a chair
     with his feet up, sweating in the heat, reading the DIARY.

                             &lt;b&gt;MARY&#39;S VOICE&lt;/b&gt; (V.O.)
                       (as Welles reads)
                 &quot;... We&#39;re reading The Great Gatsby
                 in English class.  It&#39;s the story of
                 this guy who has lots of fancy
                 parties and all his friends come
                 around and party with him, but later
                 when he dies nobody comes to his
                 funeral.  Someone said there&#39;s a
                 movie about it, but I looked in the
                 video store and it wasn&#39;t there.&quot;

     Welles flips pages, further back in the DIARY...

                             &lt;b&gt;MARY&#39;S VOICE&lt;/b&gt; (V.O.)
                       (as Welles reads)
                 &quot;Dear diary.  I started my first job
                 last week working part time at Price
                 Mart department store...&quot;

     INT.  LOS ANGELES BANK, SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles and a BANK EMPLOYEE both put keys into a SAFE DEPOSIT

                             &lt;b&gt;MARY&#39;S VOICE&lt;/b&gt; (V.O., cont)
                 &quot;... The people I work with are all
                 old and fat.  All they live for is
                 their next coffee break so they can
                 smoke...&quot;

     INT.  BANK, PRIVACY BOOTH -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     Welles is alone, opens the empty safe deposit drawer, takes

                             &lt;b&gt;MARY&#39;S VOICE&lt;/b&gt; (V.O., cont)
                 &quot;... They eat lunch at the snack
                 counter.  Hot dogs and soft
                 pretzels.  Nachos with that orange
                 cheese that comes out of a pump.  I
                 don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do if I&#39;m still
                 working there when I get old...&quot;

     EXT.  YOUTH HOSTEL -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     A large NEON CROSS identifies this HOSTEL in mid-Hollywood.

                 &quot;... I want to be a singer or an
                 actress.  I know it&#39;s a stupid
                 dream, but I know I can do it if I
                 get a chance...&quot;

     INT.  YOUTH HOSTEL -- DAY -- MONTAGE
 
     Welles talks to the MAN behind the counter, shows the
     PICTURE of MARY taken from Mrs. Mathews&#39; house.

                             &lt;b&gt;MARY&#39;S VOICE&lt;/b&gt; (V.O., cont)
                 &quot;... Everyone&#39;s always telling me
                 how pretty I am.  I don&#39;t think I
                 am.  When I look in the mirror I
                 wonder who they&#39;re talking about.&quot;

     The MAN behind the counter shakes his head.

     INT.  HOMELESS SHELTER -- DAY -- MONTAGE

                 &quot;Dear diary.  I went out with Bob

                 &quot;... It was the middle of the day,
                 but we held hands.  I think he likes
                 me.  I really like him.  He has

                 &quot;... He opened the car door for me
                 and paid for the movie.  When he
                 took me home he said we should go
                 out again soon.  I hope he calls...&quot;

     at decaying &quot;PEEP SHOWS,&quot; an &quot;ADULT BOOKSHOP&quot; and &quot;SEX SHOP.&quot;

                             &lt;b&gt;MARY&#39;S VOICE&lt;/b&gt; (V.O., cont)
                 &quot;Dear diary.  Janet says she slept
                 with her boyfriend.  I can&#39;t believe
                 it.  She says they did it last
                 weekend while her parents were out
                 of town...&quot;

     EXT.  HOLLYWOOD, SUNSET BOULEVARD -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

                 &quot;... She said she liked it, but she
                 didn&#39;t seem too happy.  She didn&#39;t
                 tell me many details.  She said he
                 used a condom.&quot;

     EXT.  SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Teenaged MALE PROSTITUTES hang out in front of a PIZZA

                             &lt;b&gt;MARY&#39;S VOICE&lt;/b&gt; (V.O., cont)
                 &quot;Dear diary.  If I save enough money
                 to go to community college maybe I
                 can get good enough grades for a
                 scholarship somewhere else...&quot;

                 &quot;... I&#39;ve never been anywhere else.
                 I don&#39;t think mom wants to let me
                 go.  Every time I try to talk about
                 it she says it&#39;ll cost too much or
                 she changes the subject.&quot;

     EXT.  CHURCH, SOUP KITCHEN -- DAY -- MONTAGE

     A long line of HOMELESS PERSONS trails out the door.  Welles
     stands out front, showing the PICTURE to a VOLUNTEER with a
     broom, and a PRIEST...

                             &lt;b&gt;MARY&#39;S VOICE&lt;/b&gt; (V.O., cont)
                 &quot;Dear diary.  Something terrible
                 happened today when dad and I were
                 alone.  I can&#39;t tell anyone.  I feel
                 sick.  What did I ever do to make
                 this happen to me?&quot;

     The volunteer and priest can&#39;t help.  Welles is weary,
     futility beginning to wear on him, walks to his car...

                             &lt;b&gt;MARY&#39;S VOICE&lt;/b&gt; (V.O., cont)
                 &quot;Dear diary.  My stomach hurts all
                 the time.  I just want to go to
                 sleep and never wake up.  I want to
                 get out of my head and stop hearing
                 myself think.&quot;

     INT.  WELLES&#39; RENTAL CAR -- IN MOTION -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles smokes, driving, blankly watching the road ahead...

                 &quot;Dear diary.  Grandma fell and broke
                 her leg last week.  We drove down to
                 visit her in the hospital.
                 Hospitals smell like dead people.&quot;

     EXT.  FREEWAY -- &lt;u&gt;HELICOPTER SHOT&lt;/u&gt; -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     FOLLOW Welles&#39; car speeding along...

                             &lt;b&gt;MARY&#39;S VOICE&lt;/b&gt; (V.O., cont)
                 &quot;Dear diary.  It&#39;s happening all the
                 time now.  There s nothing I can do.
                 I&#39;m all alone.  Everything is bad.
                 I used to have lots of dreams and
                 I&#39;d remember them when I woke up,
                 but that doesn&#39;t happen anymore.&quot;

     PULL BACK: still FOLLOWING WELLES&#39; CAR, over the FREEWAY...

                             &lt;b&gt;MARY&#39;S VOICE&lt;/b&gt; (V.O., cont)
                 &quot;Dear diary.  If I can get to
                 California, I&#39;ll be okay.  I&#39;ve got
                 money saved.  I can work as a
                 waitress till I get something
                 better.  Billy says he and his
                 family went to California once on
                 vacation.  He says it never rains.
                 They stayed near the beach and he
                 went swimming in the ocean...&quot;

     CONTINUE TO PULL BACK -- till Welles&#39; car is very, very far
     below -- REVEALING the staggering size of the City of Los
     Angeles, where the lights go on forever and forever.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles is seated, elbows on his knees, reading the DIARY...

                             &lt;b&gt;MARY&#39;S VOICE&lt;/b&gt; (V.O., cont)
                 &quot;... I hope I can be an actress.  I
                 hope I can be happy.  I&#39;ll probably
                 have to go to acting school.  I wish
                 I knew someone who lived there.
                 I&#39;ll miss my friends, but at least
                 I&#39;ll be far away where no one can
                 ever find me.&quot;

     Welles has come to the end of the writing in the DIARY.  The
     next PHOTOCOPIED PAGE shows an image of the TORN RAGGED EDGE
     of the diary&#39;s missing page.


     EXT.  VIDEO PORN SHOP -- DAY

     Welles enters this &quot;ADULT VIDEO&quot; storefront.

     INT.  VIDEO PORN SHOP -- DAY

     The CLERK is a sleazy forty-year-old man with rings in his
     pierced nose and lips, behind a counter by the door.  He
     watches Welles pass.

     Welles looks around, uncomfortable.  A few of the other
     CUSTOMERS, all men, sneak glances at Welles.  Display
     shelves run floor to ceiling, full of hundreds of shrink-
     wrapped XXX PORNO TAPES.  Welles pretends to browse.

     Handmade signs above each section identify content: &quot;ANAL,&quot;
     &quot;BIG TITS,&quot; &quot;CUMSHOTS,&quot; &quot;BONDAGE and FETISH,&quot; etc...

     Welles looks back at the clerk, who stares at Welles.
     Welles feels obligated to pick up a box and act like he&#39;s
     considering it.  He glances at other customers.

     Each man keeps his eyes forward on the pornography.  One guy
     has his arms full of about ten videos.

     Welles puts the tape back, walks to the front counter.  The
     clerk watches him the whole time.

                             WELLES
                 Is this pretty much it?

     The clerk just stares at Welles.

                             WELLES
                 Just... just videos?

                             PIERCED CLERK
                 What are you looking for?

     Welles considers, decides to leave, exiting...

                             WELLES
                 Nothing.

                             PIERCED CLERK
                 Fuck-head.


     INT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY

     Welles comes in through the blacked-out door.  This place is
     larger than the last.  TWO CLERKS are behind the counter.
     One clerk&#39;s pricing porn, the other, MAX, 25, reads a porno-
     novel.  Max has long hair, colorful tattoos covering his
     forearms, has a HIGHLIGHTER MARKER in his mouth.

     Welles browses.  There&#39;s a huge video bargain bin.  Walls
     are covered in videos, sex toys, inflatable women, etc. 

     CUSTOMERS, again all wary males, follow proper porn-shop
     etiquette; look at the porn, not your fellow shopper.

     There are &quot;PEEP SHOW&quot; booths in the back.  A MAN looks
     around, trying to be nonchalant, sweating profusely,
     slipping behind one curtain.

     Welles pretends to read the packaging on a triple-pack of
     dildos, looks towards the front...

     Behind the register, Max takes a look to make sure the other
     clerk is busy, takes the cap of his Highlighter pen and
     highlights a section in the book he&#39;s reading.

     Welles notes this.  He goes to the substantial MAGAZINE
     RACK, picks up a porn tabloid, pages through it.  He selects
     sex MAGAZINES and NEWSPAPERS, choosing about twenty-five.

     Welles takes this pile up to Max, gets out his wallet.  Max
     starts ringing everything up.

                             MAX
                 Big date tonight?

                             WELLES
                       (embarrassed)
                 Yeah... guess so.

                             MAX 
                 Can I interest you in a battery
                 operated-vagina?

                             WELLES
                 Pardon me?

                             MAX
                 My boss tells me I have to do more
                 suggestive selling.

                             WELLES 
                 Well, it&#39;s tempting, but no thanks.

                             MAX
                 It&#39;s your call, but you&#39;re gonna be
                 sorry when you&#39;re in one of those
                 everyday situations that call for a
                 battery-operated vagina and you
                 don&#39;t have one.

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;ll risk it. 

     Max shoves everything into a bag and hands it over.

                             MAX
                 Thank you for shopping at Adult
                 Bookstore.  Have a nice day.

     Welles takes the bag.  Max returns to his book.  Welles is
     leaving, but stops at the end of the counter.

                             WELLES
                 What are you reading?

     Max holds up the book, &quot;ANAL SECRETARY.&quot;

                             MAX
                 Once you pick it up you can&#39;t put it
                 down.

                             WELLES
                 Catchy title.  What are you really
                 reading?
                       (off Max&#39;s look)
                 Hard to believe that book&#39;s got any
                 parts worth highlighting.

     Max takes a glance at the other clerk, opens the pages of
     the book and shows it to Welles.  &quot;&lt;b&gt;Music for Chameleons.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

                             WELLES
                 Truman Capote.

                             MAX
                 I tear off the cover and paste this
                 one on...
                       (nods towards clerk)
                 You know how it is.

                             WELLES
                 Wouldn&#39;t want to embarrass yourself
                 in front of your fellow perverts.

                             MAX
                       (smiles, shrugs)
                 Might get drummed out of the
                 pornographer&#39;s union, and then where
                 would I be?

     Another CUSTOMER clears his throat, waiting at the register.
     Max turns to help him.  Welles heads out.


     INT.  WELLES&#39; ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles is at a table, porn publications spread out before
     him, looking through the back of a PORNO TABLOID...

     Turning pages of HARDCORE ADVERTISEMENTS: &quot;&lt;b&gt;Adults Only,&lt;/b&gt;&quot;
     &quot;&lt;b&gt;She Male Films,&lt;/b&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;b&gt;Amateur Sex Videos,&lt;/b&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;b&gt;Women and
     Animals -- you&#39;ve got to see it to believe it...&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

     Welles moves on to the next MAGAZINE, turning to the back,
     again, page after page: &quot;&lt;b&gt;Watersports and Fisting
     Specialists,&lt;/b&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;b&gt;100&#39;s of Anal Films,&lt;/b&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;b&gt;Asian Sex...&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

     HUNDREDS of &lt;b&gt;900 NUMBER&lt;/b&gt; ads with naked women urging callers
     to pick up the phone.  &lt;b&gt;EROTIC CLASSIFIEDS&lt;/b&gt;; hundreds of
     amateur photos of naked men and women with faces and
     genitalia blacked over... &quot;&lt;b&gt;Men Seeking Women,&lt;/b&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;b&gt;Women
     Seeking Women&lt;/b&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;b&gt;Men Seeking Men,&lt;/b&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;b&gt;Transvestites...&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

     It is endless.  More &lt;b&gt;CLASSIFIEDS&lt;/b&gt;: &quot;&lt;b&gt;Sex Slaves Wanted,&lt;/b&gt;&quot;
     &quot;&lt;b&gt;ACTRESSES WANTED,&lt;/b&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;b&gt;Underground Films,&lt;/b&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;b&gt;SPECIALTY FILMS
     OFFERED,&lt;/b&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;b&gt;S+M and BONDAGE,&lt;/b&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;b&gt;Fetish Videos.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

     Welles leaves it, overwhelmed, goes to lay down on the bed.
     He picks up his cellular phone, dialing.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Hi, honey, how are you?  How&#39;s Cindy?
                       (listens)
                 The way it&#39;s going I&#39;m about ready
                 to pack my bags...

     INT.  NONDESCRIPT ROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     In a dark room, we don&#39;t know where, a DARK FIGURE of a MAN
     is silhouetted.  He wears HEADPHONES, &lt;u&gt;listening&lt;/u&gt;...

                             WELLES&#39; VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphones)
                 ... I&#39;ve got a feeling the person
                 I&#39;m looking for came out here and
                 got swallowed up by the place.

                             AMY&#39;S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphone)
                 Come back now. Just drop it and
                 come back...

                             WELLES&#39; VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphone)
                 I would if I could.  I&#39;ll be home
                 soon, believe me.  It won&#39;t be long.

                             AMY&#39;S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphone)
                 I miss you.

     INT.  WELLES ROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles shuts his eyes, still on the cellular...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 I miss you too.  I love you very
                 much.  Give Cinderella a kiss for me
                 and tell her I love her, alright?
                       (listens)
                 Goodnight.


     INT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY

     Max is at the register.  A crewcut WOMAN in overalls works
     behind the counter with him.  Welles approaches.

                             WELLES
                 Remember me?

                             MAX
                 Came back for that battery-operated
                 vagina, right?  Told you you would.

     Welles shows his IDENTIFICATION, lets Max get a good look.

                             WELLES
                 I need some information.  Thought
                 you might be able to help.

                             MAX
                       (of identification)
                 Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.

     Welles takes out an ENVELOPE, puts it on the counter.

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;ll be outside having a cigarette.

     Welles leaves.  Max watches him go.  Max opens the envelope,
     takes out two fifty dollar bills, pockets them.

                             MAX
                       (to other clerk)
                 Cover me, Beth.  I&#39;m taking a break.

     EXT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY

     Welles stands down the sidewalk, smoking.  Max comes out
     from the porn shop, walks to Welles, looking around.

                             MAX
                 I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re looking
                 for, mister, but so we&#39;re clear from
                 the start, I&#39;m straight.

                             WELLES
                 Good for you.

     Welles and Max walk down the block, past HOMELESS MEN with
     shopping carts overflowing with junk.

                             WELLES
                 How long you been working there?

                             MAX
                 Three, four years.

                             WELLES
                 What&#39;s your name, if you don&#39;t mind
                 me asking? 

                             MAX
                 Max.

                             WELLES
                 Well, here&#39;s the deal, Max.  This
                 thing I&#39;m on right now has something
                 to do with underground pornography.
                 Stuff that&#39;s sold under the counter,
                 illegally...

                             MAX
                 There&#39;s not much illegal.

                             WELLES
                 Well, whatever there is, whoever&#39;s
                 dealing, however it&#39;s done, I want
                 to know.  I want a good look, so if
                 you&#39;ve got that kind of connection,
                 great.  If not, speak now.

                             MAX
                 You&#39;re not a cop, are you?  If I ask
                 and you are, you have to tell me.

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;m not a cop.

                             MAX
                 You&#39;re a private eye.  Like Shaft.

                             WELLES
                 Not quite.

                             MAX
                 From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA.
                 What are you doing out here?

                             WELLES
                 Well, there&#39;s the thing; you&#39;re not
                 gonna know anything about what I&#39;m
                 doing, but you can make some money.

                             MAX
                 How much?

                             WELLES
                 How much do you make now?

                             MAX
                 Four hundred a week, off the books.

                             WELLES
                 Okay, let&#39;s pretend I live in the
                 same fantasy world where you make
                 four hundred a week in that dump.
                 I&#39;ll give you six hundred for a few
                 days. 

                             MAX
                 Sounds good, pops.

                             WELLES
                 Here&#39;s my number if you need it...
                       (writes on scrap paper)
                 When can you start?

                             MAX
                 Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.

                             WELLES
                 See you then.  Oh, and, don&#39;t call
                 me &quot;pops.&quot;

     Welles walks away. 


     INT.  WELLES ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles sleeps, despite the stead SOUND of TRAFFIC racing by
     his window.  The PHONE RINGS, waking him.  Welles looks at
     the clock radio, &lt;b&gt;2:23&lt;/b&gt;am, reaches to answer the phone...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 ... Hello... ?

                             MAX (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Wake up, pops.  Your education
                 begins tonight.

     EXT.  DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT

     Against the backdrop of downtown LA&#39;s bright skyscrapers,
     Welles&#39; rental car heads into the lower bowels of the city,
     smaller, older, darker buildings...

     EXT.  DOWNTOWN STREETS -- NIGHT

     The only people on the street are HOMELESS and SHADY
     CHARACTERS.  Welles&#39; car makes its way to a big deserted
     PARKING LOT.  There are a few cars parked in one corner.

     Welles parks near the other cars and gets out.  Max stands
     against a chain link fence.  Welles goes to meet him.

                             MAX
                 Come on.

     Max leads the way, across the lot, towards dark alleyways.

     EXT.  DOWNTOWN ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT

     Max and Welles move through this filth strewn alley between
     decaying brink buildings.  They cone to a STAIRWELL leading
     down to pitch dark...

     INT.  OLD BUILDING -- NIGHT

     Max enters through a crooked door, heads into a narrow,
     labyrinth hallway lit by bare bulbs.  Welles follows.

     They come to another STAIRWAY leading down.  At the bottom,
     a thick-necked GOON stands guarding double doors. 

                             GOON
                 Are you a law enforcement agent or
                 in any way affiliated with law
                 enforcement?

                             MAX
                 Fuck you, Larry.

     Max heads to the double doors, waits for Welles.

                             GOON
                       (to Welles)
                 Are you a law enforcement... ?

                             WELLES
                 No.

     INT.  BASEMENT -- NIGHT

     Max and Welles enter through the double doors, into a kind
     of small, underground porn flea market.  It&#39;s incredibly
     quiet.  About fifteen CARD TABLES are set up in rows.  The
     MEN behind the tables and the thirty or so &quot;CUSTOMERS&quot;
     looking through the merchandise make those in the previous
     porn shops look like high society.

     These are MIDDLE-AGED MEN, most balding, some with pot
     bellies, in shorts and tube socks, in sweatpants and Members
     Only jackets: plain men, but with a look of desperation in
     their eyes, glancing around nervously, greasy and afraid.

                             ONE DEALER
                 We&#39;re shutting down in fifteen
                 minutes.  Fifteen minutes.

     Welles makes his way to the tables, wary.  One table is
     covered in dirty cardboard boxes, filled with HUNDREDS of
     PHOTOS of young children, mostly boys, naked.  Each photo is
     wrapped in plastic, censored by masking tape.

     Welles swallows back disgust.

     The next table is piled high with used pornographic
     MAGAZINES.  There are baggies with COLORFUL PILLS laid out.
     X-rated Polaroids wrapped in rubberbands.

     Max follows behind, unaffected, smokes a cigarette.

     Another table offers VIDEO TAPES with no identifying marks
     other than hand written labels with numbers written out,
     &quot;&lt;b&gt;two,&lt;/b&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;b&gt;sixteen,&lt;/b&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;b&gt;five.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;  And many bootleg VIDEOS with
     grainy, homemade labels showing WOMEN in extreme BONDAGE.

     Welles watches out the corner of his eye as the PLUMP MAN
     beside him pays for a thick stack of kiddie porn pictures.
     Welles waits till the man moves on, addresses the angry
     looking DEALER who&#39;s counting money.

                             WELLES
                       (points to numbered videos)
                 What are these?

                             ANGRY DEALER
                 Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films.
                 Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.

     Welles looks around, wipes sweat off his top lip.

                             WELLES
                 Anything harder?

                             ANGRY DEALER
                 There&#39;s nothing harder.

                             WELLES
                 Snuff?

                             ANGRY DEALER
                 What you see is what I got, mister.

                             WELLES
                 You know where I can get it?  I have
                 a lot of money to spend.

                             ANGRY DEALER
                 There ain&#39;t no such thing as snuff.
                 Why don&#39;t you fuck off? 

     The dealer sits and keeps counting cash.
     Welles moves on Beyond the tables there&#39;s a CURTAINED
     DOORWAY.  Welles walks to it, enters...

     INSIDE THE CURTAIN

     Folding chairs face a SCREEN.  A PROJECTOR shows a silent
     movie; a BUXOM WOMAN in nurses uniform prepares an enema bag
     and tube.  A hairy, overweight MAN lays face down on an
     examination table, naked, arms tied behind his back.

     In the darkness, a MAN shifts in his chair, grunting,
     obviously masturbating.  A few chairs away, a man is bent
     over, moving his head in the lap of SOMEONE in a BLONDE WIG.

     A LARGE MAN approaches Welles from the dark.

                             LARGE MAN
                 You have to pay to come in here. 

     Welles backs away, shuts the curtain.


     INT.  ALL-NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT

     Not many people in the place.  Welles drinks coffee.  Max
     eats a huge breakfast.

                             MAX
                 You&#39;ve got Penthouse, Playboy,
                 Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers
                 them pornography anymore.  Then,
                 there&#39;s mainstream hardcore.  Triple
                 X.  The difference is penetration.
                 That&#39;s hardcore.  That whole
                 industry&#39;s up in the valley.
                 Writers, directors, porn stars.
                 They&#39;re celebrities, or they think
                 they are.  They pump out 150 videos
                 a week.  A &lt;u&gt;week&lt;/u&gt;.  They&#39;ve even got
                 a porno Academy Awards.  America
                 loves pornography.  Anybody tells
                 you they never use pornography,
                 they&#39;re lying.  Somebody&#39;s buying
                 those videos.  Somebody&#39;s out there
                 spending 900 million dollars a year
                 on phone sex.  Know what else?  It&#39;s
                 only gonna get worse.  More and more
                 you&#39;ll see perverse hardcore coming
                 into the mainstream, because that&#39;s
                 evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my
                 God, Elvis Presley&#39;s wiggling his
                 hips, how offensive!  Nowadays,
                 Mtv&#39;s showing girls dancing around
                 in thong bikinis with their asses
                 hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For
                 the porn-addict, big tits aren&#39;t big
                 enough after a while.  They have to
                 be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn
                 chicks are putting in breast
                 implants bigger than your head,
                 literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be
                 Penthouse, Penthouse&#39;ll be Hustler,
                 Hustler&#39;ll be hardcore, and hardcore
                 films&#39;ll be medical films.
                 People&#39;ll be jerking off to women
                 laying around with open wounds.
                 There&#39;s nowhere else for it to go.

                             WELLES
                 Interesting theory.

                             MAX
                 What you saw tonight, we&#39;re not
                 talking about a video some dentist
                 takes home over the weekend.  We&#39;re
                 talking about stuff where people get
                 hurt.  Specialty product. 

                             WELLES
                 Child pornography.

                             MAX
                 There&#39;s two kinds of specialty
                 product; legal and illegal.  Foot
                 fetish, shit films, watersports,
                 bondage, spanking, fisting, she-
                 males, hemaphrodites... it&#39;s beyond
                 hardcore, but legal.  This is the
                 kind of hardcore where one guy&#39;s
                 going to look at it and throw up,
                 another guy looks at it and falls in
                 love.  Now, with some of the S+M and
                 bondage films, they straddle the
                 line.  How are you supposed to tell
                 if the person tied up with the ball
                 gag in their mouth is a consenting
                 or not?  Step over that line, you&#39;re
                 into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but
                 there aren&#39;t many.  I&#39;ve never seen
                 one.

                             WELLES
                 Snuff films.

                             MAX
                 I heard you asking.  That guy wasn&#39;t
                 yanking you around.  There&#39;s no such
                 thing.

                             WELLES
                 What other ways are there to get
                 illegal films?  Who do you see?

                             MAX
                 First of all, basement sales like
                 tonight aren&#39;t gonna last much
                 longer.  It&#39;s too risky, one, and
                 two, everything&#39;s going on the
                 internet.  Anyone with a computer
                 and enough patience can find
                 anything he wants.  It&#39;s heaven for
                 those degenerate chicken-hawks.
                 They&#39;re swapping pictures back and
                 forth as fast as their modems can
                 zap &#39;em.  But, there&#39;s still some
                 weird shit under the counter where
                 I work sometimes.  No one knows where
                 it comes from.  That&#39;s local
                 underground, where information
                 spreads by word of mouth.  Those are
                 zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their
                 hands are permanently pruned.  They
                 go out in the sun they don&#39;t burn,
                 they blister.  Other than that, all
                 I know about is the mail.
                 Classified ads in the paper with
                 hidden codes.  Secret couriers.
                 Credit card orders to dummy
                 corporations.  Interstate wire
                 transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes.
                 But, if you&#39;re asking me who do you
                 go to to get illegal shit... who
                 knows?  That&#39;s the whole point --
                 the seller stays as far away from
                 the buyer as possible, and vice
                 versa, and cops can&#39;t trace the
                 deal.  There&#39;s ways to do it so
                 nobody knows who anybody is.

     Welles watches Max eat.

                             WELLES
                 How old are you?

                             MAX
                 Twenty-five.

                             WELLES
                 Where are your parents?

                             MAX
                 I don&#39;t know, where are yours?

                             WELLES
                 I don&#39;t mean any offense... but what
                 are you doing mixed up in all this?

                             MAX
                 I&#39;m not mixed up in anything,
                 hayseed.  What are you talking about?

                             WELLES
                 You just strike me as smart enough
                 to be doing something else.

                             MAX
                 Yeah, I&#39;m a real genius.  What
                 choices have I got?  Fuck, just
                 because I know about stuff like
                 tonight doesn&#39;t mean I deal it.  I
                 work a job.  It beats pumping gas,
                 beats making hamburgers.

                             WELLES
                 You&#39;re telling me it doesn&#39;t get to
                 you?

                             MAX
                 You can&#39;t sit there all day watching
                 the parade of losers that comes into
                 that place without going numb.  So
                 what? 
                 Am I gonna go off and be a race car
                 driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for
                 President?  What about you, pops?

                             WELLES
                 What about me?

                             MAX
                 I see a ring on your finger.  You
                 have any kids?

                             WELLES
                 A daughter.

                             MAX
                 So, you have a wife and kid waiting
                 for you in Pennsylvania... what are
                 &lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt; doing mixed up in all this?

                             WELLES
                 Good question.

     EXT.  ALL NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT

     Max and Welles comes out to the sidewalk, talking.

     ACROSS THE STREET

     INSIDE A PARKED CAR, through the windshield, SOMEONE watches
     Max and Welles say goodnight.  Max walks to a waiting taxi.

     It&#39;s the sinister lawyer watching, LONGDALE, the late Mr.
     Christian&#39;s attorney, watching Welles go to his rental car.


     INT.  WELLES&#39; ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE

     Welles is seated, PROJECTOR RUNNING, watching the 8MM film.

     The last of the film makes its way through, threading out.
     The take-up reel spins, the film&#39;s tail flapping...

     Welles stares at the blank white square of light projected
     onto the wall.  CELLULAR PHONE is HEARD RINGING...

     Welles finally looks to the projector, turns it off.  The
     PHONE&#39;S RINGING.  Welles goes to sit on the bed, looking at
     the cellular phone on the bedside table.  RINGING...

     Welles lets it RING.  RINGING... RINGING... till it finally
     stops.  Welles lays back on the bed and shuts his eyes.


     INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, MR CHRISTIAN&#39;S OFFICE -- DAY

     Mrs. Christian is behind the desk, surrounded by BOXES of
     BANK RECORDS and FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, on the PHONE. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                       (into phone)
                 My husband had five cash accounts he
                 used to temporarily hold stock
                 profits.  Between November of 1991
                 and March of 1992, he wrote one
                 check out to cash from each account.
                 He wrote these himself...

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH, HOLLYWOOD -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles is in the booth, listening...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Okay...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 My husband never dealt with money
                 personally, certainly not cash.

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;m not positive this means anything.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 The checks were for odd amounts...

     INT.  MR CHRISTIAN&#39;S OFFICE -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

     Mrs. Christian has the amounts written out on paper.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                       (into phone)
                 One was for two hundred thousand,
                 one dollar and thirteen cents.
                 Another was for three hundred
                 thousand, six hundred fifty four
                 dollars and seventy six cents...

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Okay, I follow you so far...

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 Totalled together, these five checks
                 from five different accounts, they
                 equal one million dollars.

                       (into phone)
                 You&#39;re joking.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 To the penny.  Exactly one million
                 dollars in cash. 

     Welles considers this, lost in thought.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 Hello... ?

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;m here.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 Do you think the film could have
                 cost that much?

                             WELLES
                 For a human life... murder on film,
                 no statute of limitations.  Who
                 knows?  It sure could have.  I&#39;d
                 like you to overnight me a copy of
                 those checks, then put them in a
                 safe deposit box. 

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 Okay.

                 Send it to me through the post
                 office like we arranged.  No return
                 address.  You dug this up all by
                 yourself?

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                 You told me to look, so I looked.

                             WELLES
                 You&#39;re one hell of a detective, Mrs.
                 Christian.


     EXT.  MISSION YOUTH HOSTEL -- DAY

     TEENAGERS work cleaning this large DORMITORY, sweeping and
     mopping the floor, making the bunk beds, washing windows.
     Welles stands with an elderly, black NUN in plain clothing.

                             WELLES
                 Her name was Mary Anne Mathews.

     Welles hands the woman the PICTURE of MARY.  The woman puts
     on her glasses, looks at the picture... looks at Welles.

                             NUN
                 Yes... I remember Mary

                             WELLES
                 You... you do?  You&#39;re sure?
                 Please, Sister, will you take
                 another look, make sure... 

                             NUN 
                      (examines picture)
                 Yes.  I remember her.

     INT.  MISSION YOUTH HOSTEL, STORAGE AREA -- DAY

     In a basement corner, Welles watches as the nun uses keys to
     open the door of a chain-link STORAGE CAGE.  The cage is
     full of junk, BOXES, LAMPS, stacks of CHAIRS.

                             NUN
                 She lived here for only about a
                 month, if I recall correctly.  She
                 didn&#39;t return one night.  She never
                 came back.  I didn&#39;t know what to
                 think...

     The nun enters the cage, pushes old BOXES out of her way,
     looks up a cob-web covered METAL SHELVES.

                             NUN
                 Do you know what happened to her?

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;m trying to find out.  She was a
                 runaway.  I&#39;m looking into it for
                 her parents.

     The nun sees what she wants, finds a STEP LADDER, tries to
     open it.  Welles comes to help her.

                             NUN
                       (pointing on shelf)
                 Can you get that down for me?

     Welles climbs the ladder, points at boxes...

                             NUN
                 No, the next shelf... there...

     Welles takes down a small SUITCASE.  It&#39;s covered in dust.
     He climbs down the ladder with it.

                             WELLES
                 What is this?

                             NUN
                 Those are her belongings.

                             WELLES
                 Her belongings?

                             NUN
                 That&#39;s her suitcase.  I had
                 forgotten it, till you showed me
                 her picture.

     Welles puts the suitcase down, examines the LUGGAGE TAG:
     &quot;&lt;b&gt;Mary Anne Mathews,&lt;/b&gt;&quot; no address.  Welles looks to the nun. 

                             WELLES
                 Whatever possessed you to keep this
                 all this time?

                             NUN
                 She was the kindest, sweetest girl
                 you&#39;d ever want to meet.  Oh, I
                 adored her.  I supposed I always
                 hoped she&#39;d be back.  After a time,
                 all I could do was pray she had
                 moved on to better things.  Can you
                 get this suitcase to her parents, if
                 you think it&#39;s appropriate?

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;ll do what I can.


     INT.  WELLES&#39; ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles puts Mary&#39;s SUITCASE on the bed, opens it.  He takes
     out some of Mary&#39;s clothing, examines it, lays it aside.

     He takes out a ROSARY, more CLOTHING.  Resting on a SWEATER
     are two CERAMIC FIGURINES; a teddy bear and kitten.  Welles
     examines them, frowning, puts them aside.

     He takes out yellowed NEWSPAPER; Help Wanted CLASSIFIEDS,
     &quot;&lt;b&gt;July 2, 1992.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;  Several job possibilities circled, others
     crossed out.  He finds baggie containing a few old JOINTS.

     All that&#39;s left are more items of CLOTHING, a TOOTHBRUSH and
     an ADDRESS BOOK.  Welles examines the address book, finds a
     folded piece of paper in the blank pages, unfolds it... it&#39;s
     the TORN DIARY PAGE, a POEM written in Mary&#39;s hand...

                             &lt;b&gt;MARY&#39;S VOICE&lt;/b&gt; (V.O.)
                       (as Welles reads)
                 &quot;Star light, star bright, First star
                 I&#39;ve seen tonight, Wish I may, wish
                 I might, Have this wish I wish
                 tonight.&quot;

     Welles goes to a drawer, takes out the photocopy of Mary&#39;s
     DIARY.  He turns to the ragged edge of the torn page, puts
     the DIARY PAGE against it.  Perfect match.

     Welles stands looking at the poem.  He turns the page over,
     finds written, in cursive:

                           &lt;b&gt;Models Wanted 213-555-6643&lt;/b&gt;


     EXT.  PHONE BOOTH -- DAY

     Welles dials the number off the back of the torn diary page,
     phone to his ear.  It RINGS, RINGS, RINGS... 

                             MAN&#39;S VOICE (V.O.) 
                       (from phone)
                 Celebrity Films.

     Welles hangs up, begins searching the booth&#39;s YELLOW PAGES.

     EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

     A poverty stricken business section of Wilshire.  Welles
     gets out of his parked car, looks up at a decaying Art Deco
     building that&#39;s painted blue top-to-bottom.

     Welles crosses through traffic.

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, LOBBY -- DAY

     Welles studies the REGISTRY, finds &quot;&lt;b&gt;Celebrity Films.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- DAY

     Paint&#39;s peeling.  Walls are water stained.  Welles climbs
     stairs, winded, sweating, up the stairwell...

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- DAY

     Welles comes out a stairwell DOOR, catching his breath.  A
     couple of SECRETARIES wait for the elevator.  Welles moves
     down the hall, around a corner.

     Each office door has a window of pebbled, translucent glass.
     There&#39;s a &quot;Dental Office,&quot; &quot;Wilson Travel Cruises,&quot; and at
     the end of the hall, &quot;&lt;b&gt;Celebrity Films Inc., Eddie Poole,
     Professional Casting and Distribution, Suite 804.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

     Welles heads back the way he came.

     EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

     Welles crosses back to the other side of the street, goes to
     stand near his car.  He looks up at the blue office
     building, counting up floors, counting windows across.

     Satisfied, he turns, backing up, looking up at the tall
     OFFICE BUILDING across from the blue building.  There&#39;s a
     sign on this adjacent building, &quot;&lt;b&gt;OFFICE SPACE AVAILABLE.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE, 9TH FLOOR -- DAY

     Empty office.  Welles is let in by a disinterested LANDLORD.
     Welles gives a cursory look around, goes to the windows and
     opens the blinds.

     These windows afford an excellent view of the blue building
     across the street, at about 8th floor level.

                             WELLES 
                 This is better. 
                       (turns to landlord) 
                 This will be fine.


     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Welles has transferred most of his belongings here, SUITCASE
     open on the floor, CARD TABLE set up with fast food on it,
     an ARMY COT against one wall.  Welles sits in a chair at the
     window, looks through BINOCULARS on a TRIPOD.

     WELLES&#39; P.O.V., THROUGH BINOCULARS: searching up the dark
     floors of the blue building, as Welles counts under his
     breath.  Moving over... stopping on one window, FOCUSING...

     Welles locks the tripod.  He goes to sit on the army cot,
     picks up his CELLULAR.  He looks at the phone, deciding.
     He puts down the phone.  He turns off the LAMP on the floor,
     lays back in the cot, going to sleep.


     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     WELLES&#39; P.O.V., THROUGH BINOCULARS: watching the window of
     Celebrity Films Inc.  We can see most of the office from
     here.  It&#39;s crowded with junk, BOXES, piles of VIDEO TAPES.
     There&#39;s a disorganized DESK by the window.

     Welles sits looking through the binoculars.

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: a pudgy man, EDDIE POOLE, in a loud,
     print shirt, comes to sit at the desk, looks through mail.
     He smells sleazy even from here, lots of jewelry, Lots of
     rings.  He drinks coffee, answers the phone.  He talks into
     the phone, looking for something on his desk, agitation
     growing, till he&#39;s shouting, then slams the phone down.

     Welles rises.  He looks to the wall where THREE PHOTOGRAPHS
     culled from the snuff film are pinned up; the picture of
     Mary, the picture of Masked Man&#39;s tattooed hand, and...

     ... the grainy image of the Third Man in the mirror.
     Welles comes to study this third photo.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie packs VIDEO TAPES into a box,
     covering them with Styrofoam peanuts, sealing the box.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie finishes a call and hangs up.  He
     sits back in his chair.  He starts looking in his desk
     drawers, finds a MAGAZINE and opens it on the desk.  It&#39;s
     porn.  Eddie turns pages, looking at naked women.  He sits
     back in his chair, begins unbuckling his belt.

     Welles pulls back from the binoculars in disgust. 

                             WELLES 
                 No thank you.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- NIGHT

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie&#39;s on the phone, pouring himself a
     drink from the liquor bottle on his desk, finishing the
     call, hanging up.  He shakes his head in disgust, drinks the
     drink, walks out of view.  After a moment, the lights go out.

     EXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS -- NIGHT

     An old, dented CAR makes its way up the tight, twisting
     roads of the Hollywood Hills.  Eddie&#39;s at the wheel.  Not
     far behind, Welles&#39; rental car follows...

     FURTHER ON

     Eddie&#39;s car pulls into the driveway under the porch of a
     ramshackle HOUSE, parks.  Welles&#39; car passes by...

     FURTHER, AROUND A CURVE

     Welles&#39; car slows once it&#39;s out of sight, turns around,
     moving back down the hill, slowly...

     INT.  WELLES&#39; CAR -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles turns out his headlights, coming around the curve
     just far enough so the ramshackle house is in view.  Welles
     watches Eddie walk up the stairs to the house.

                                              FADE TO BLACK:

     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie has a visitor.  There&#39;s a pretty
     GIRL, wearing a tube top, in a chair facing his desk.
     Eddie&#39;s talking, gesticulating, smiling, cajoling.

     Welles watches through binoculars.

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie&#39;s still taking, stands, coming
     around the desk and placing a hand on the girl&#39;s shoulder.
     The girl says something.  Eddie responds.  The woman shakes
     her head, getting up to leave.  Eddie seems to be asking her
     to stay, following as she moves out of view.  Eddie comes
     back alone, sits at his desk, picks up the phone.


     INT.  ESPIONAGE SHOP -- DAY

     Ultra high tech for sale.  Welles examines items on the
     sales counter as the SALESPERSON watches: a pair of sma1l,
     round LISTENING DEVICES, a complicated RECEIVER/TAPE
     RECORDER, and a TONE DECODER with LED window.

                             WELLES 
                 Okay, I&#39;ll take it all.

                             SALESPERSON 
                 Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and
                 American Express.

                             WELLES
                 Cash.

     Welles takes out a thick wad, starts counting.

                             SALESPERSON
                 Alright.
                       (at register) 
                 May I have your phone number, area
                 code first?

                             WELLES
                 No, you may not.

                             SALESPERSON
                 Okay.  Fine.

     Welles lays the money on the counter.  The salesperson takes
     the money, recounting.

                             SALESPERSON
                 I&#39;m required by state law to inform
                 you that, while it&#39;s perfectly legal
                 for you to purchase these items, it
                 is illegal for you to use them for
                 any sort of...

                             WELLES
                 Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you
                 could bag it, I&#39;ll be on my way,
                 thank you.

                             SALESPERSON
                 Certainly, sir.

     The salesperson starts punching keys on the register.


     EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- NIGHT

     The blue building sits completely dark.

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT

     Welles comes quietly out from the stairwell, wears gloves.
     He moves down the hall to the door of &quot;Celebrity Films Inc.&quot;

     He kneels, begins using LOCK-PICKING TOOLS on the door.

     INT.  CELEBRITY FILMS OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Welles enters, shuts the door and locks it.  He takes out
     his penlight.  There are POSTERS for cheap PORN FILMS on the
     wall that we couldn&#39;t see through binoculars.  Titles like
     &quot;Sex Doctor,&quot; &quot;Deep Ass,&quot; and &quot;Penal Colony.&quot;

     There a two FILE CABINETS.  Welles pulls a few drawers,
     finds them locked.  VIDEO CASSETTES are everywhere, on the
     cabinets, on shelves, piled high on the floor.

     Welles goes to Eddie&#39;s desk, looking in drawers.  One drawer
     is full of X-RATED MAGAZINES.  Another&#39;s stuffed with
     paperwork, call sheets, contracts.

     Welles picks up Eddie&#39;s phone, unscrews the earpiece.  He
     takes the small, round LISTENING DEVICE from his pocket,
     peels off backing to expose adhesive.  He attaches the
     listening device inside the phone, puts it back together.

     Welles moves towards the door, sweeps the room with the
     penlight.  He stops at the file cabinets, takes his lock-
     picking tools out, begins working on one file&#39;s lock.

     He turns the lock, opens a file drawer.  Empty.  He opens
     another.  Inside: piles of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.

     Welles clenches his jaw.

     Faces of children.  Shirtless boys.  Girls in pigtails.


     INT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY

     Welles&#39; RECEIVER/TAPE RECORDER&#39;S set up by the window,
     recording, with the TONE DECODER plugged into it.  Welles
     LISTENS through HEADPHONE, looking through binoculars.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                       (through headphones)
                 ... half a dozen.  This is good
                 stuff, Jimbo...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie&#39;s at his desk, on the PHONE...

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 You know how my tapes sell.  People
                 eat this stuff up.

                             MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 I had three jerkoffs trying to
                 return your tapes last month.  Do
                 you know how bad a skin flick has to
                 be for some jackass to come back
                 into my place with a fucking receipt,
                 and try to fucking return it? 

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Maybe there&#39;s something wrong with
                 the scumbag customers coming into
                 your place, ever think of that?

                             MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                 The only thing wrong is the cheap,
                 softcore crap you&#39;re peddling,
                 Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Look, you cocksucker...

                             MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                 Get together some upscale product
                 where the girls still have teeth in
                 their head.  Till then, fuck you.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Fuck you!

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie slams down the phone.  He CANNOT
     BE HEARD any longer.  He&#39;s cursing, shuffling paperwork.

     Welles takes off headphones, picks up his cellular phone.
     He drinks soda, opens the phone, dials, nervous, then looks
     back through the binoculars.  He waits, clears his throat.
     The PHONE&#39;S RINGING... RINGING...

     On the floor, the REELS of the tape recorder are TURNING...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie answers the phone...

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Celebrity Films.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 Eddie.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Yeah, who&#39;s this?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 I know what you did.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 What?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 I know what you did.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Who is this.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six
                 years ago... 

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 What the fuck are you.. ?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 You killed that girl and you put it
                 on film.  You and your pals, you&#39;re
                 fucked.  You fucked up real good.

     Welles hits disconnect, still looking through binoculars.

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie&#39;s slow to hang up the phone.  He
     stands, looking down at the phone, frozen.  Finally, he runs
     his hands through his hair, looks around the room, sits back
     down.  He gets out his bottle and pours himself a drink.

     Welles watches through binoculars, puts headphones back on.

                             WELLES
                 Come on, Eddie...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie sits motionless.

                             WELLES (O.S.)
                 ... come on...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie picks up the phone, DIALS a
     NUMBER.  We hear the PHONE RING in the HEADPHONES

                             MAN&#39;S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (through headphones)
                 ... Hello?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                       (through headphones)
                 Dino, it&#39;s Eddie... Eddie Poole...

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 What do you want?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 I just got a call... two seconds
                 ago, some motherfucker called...
                 says he knows about the loop.

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 What are you talking about?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 The loop!  The girl we did, what the
                 fuck do you think I&#39;m talking
                 about?!  This guy calls and says he
                 knows about the fucking loop...

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 Bullshit.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 I&#39;m telling you... 

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that&#39;s
                 impossible.  Why are you bothering
                 me with this... ?

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Because somebody just fucking called
                 me and fucking laid it out!

                             DINO (V.O.)
                 There&#39;s nothing there, you brain-
                 dead cunt.  Think about it.  There&#39;s
                 absolutely no way in this world to
                 connect us to anything.  I want you
                 to hang the phone up, and if you
                 call me about this again I&#39;m going
                 to send a friend of mine out there
                 and have him crack you open with a
                 fucking rib spreader.

                             EDDIE (V.O.)
                 Dino...

                             DINO (V.O)
                 Nobody knows anything.

     THROUGH BINOCULARS: as DINO is HEARD HANGING UP, Eddie
     reacts, picks up his phone and throws it across the office.

     Welles sits back, trying to accept the realization that he&#39;s
     found them.  He looks to the PHOTO of the Third Man.

                             WELLES
                 That is you, isn&#39;t it, Eddie?

     Welles goes to the RECORDER, turns on the TONE DECODER.  Its
     LED window LIGHTS UP.  Welles hits STOP, REWIND, PLAY...

                             WELLES VOICE (V.O.)
                       (from recorder)
                 ... and your pals, you&#39;re fucked...

     Hits FAST FORWARD... hits PLAY, watching the TONE DECODER.
     From the RECORDER, the SOUND of EDDIE DIALING a NUMBER on
     his touch tone phone... and as EACH TONE is HEARD, a
     &lt;u&gt;corresponding NUMBER appears on the DECODER&#39;S LED readout&lt;/u&gt;:

                               &lt;b&gt;...1 212 555 9906...&lt;/b&gt;

     The recorder continues, REPLAYING the CONVERSATION between
     Eddie and Dino, while Welles studies the green LED digits.

                             WELLES
                       (quiet, to himself)
                 Two one two.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING -- NIGHT

     The brilliant lights of New York&#39;s peerless skyscrapers.

     EXT.  59TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT

     FOLLOW Welles&#39; Ford as it moves along with traffic, crossing
     the 59th Street Bridge, into the heart of Manhattan.

     EXT.  BANK -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY

     &quot;Chase Manhattan Bank,&quot; mid-town.

     INT.  CHASE MANHATTAN BANK, SAFE DEPOSIT BOOTH -- DAY

     Welles puts the 8MM FILM into SAFE DEPOSIT DRAWER, shuts it.


     INT.  NY PUBLIC LIBRARY, REFERENCE -- DAY

     Busy and crowded, but quiet.  Welles places a massive tome
     down on a table:  &quot;&lt;b&gt;Haines Criss-Cross Directory.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

     Welles sits, takes out his notepad, referring to the phone
     number written: &quot;&lt;b&gt;(212) 555-9906.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;  He opens the reference
     book, searching pages...

     Thousands of TELEPHONE NUMBERS are LISTED in SEQUENCE, each
     with an address.  Welles runs his finger down the page.

     EXT.  SOHO STREETS -- DAY

     PEDESTRIANS everywhere.  Streets are clogged with DELIVERY
     TRUCKS loading and unloading.  Cars horns blow.  Welles
     walks to an old, WAREHOUSE BUILDING shoulder to shoulder
     with other buildings, labeled &quot;&lt;b&gt;1204&lt;/b&gt;&quot; in burnished steel.

     Welles climbs the stairs, examines the buzzers.

     The top button&#39;s labeled &quot;Greystone Imports,&quot; the bottom
     button reads &quot;Lang Interior Design, by appt.&quot;  The middle
     button is labeled only by a drawing of a BLACK WIDOW SPIDER.

     Welles looks up at the building.

     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, SOHO -- LATER DAY

     The sun is low.  Less activity on the street.  Welles leans
     against a car down the street, smoking a cigarette.

     TWO WOMEN walk this way, both in spiked high heels, dressed
     in cheap, short, formfitting skirts, both carrying duffel
     bags.  They start up the stairs of 1204...

     Welles throws his cigarette, walks to follow.

     The women hit the center button.  A BUZZER sounds as they
     head inside.  Welles hurries up the stairs, catching the
     door before it closes.

     INT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, ELEVATOR -- DAY

     Welles follows the women into a decrepit ELEVATOR.  One
     woman hits &quot;2.&quot;  Welles hits &quot;3,&quot; steps back in the corner.
     Elevator doors creak closed.  The two women are heavily made
     up, pretty, but worn, eyes dull.

     Welles looks down at the leg of one woman, noticing bruises
     through her fishnet stockings, poorly covered by make-up.

     Elevator doors open on the SECOND FLOOR.  The two women get
     out and walk down a grey hallway, towards DOUBLE DOORS
     painted black.  Welles stops the elevator door from closing.

     The women push the INTERCOM at the black doors.  Another
     dull BUZZ is HEARD as the women enter.  The low rumble of
     HEAVY METAL MUSIC is HEARD, SILENCED as doors swing shut.

     Welles lets the elevator close.

     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     The elevator opens on the FIRST FLOOR.  Welles gets out,
     instead of leaving the way he came, heads towards the
     rear... FOLLOW him down a hallway, past a SERVICE ELEVATOR...

     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     Welles comes out BACK DOORS into an sunless alleyway with
     fire escapes above.  There&#39;s a TRASH DUMPSTER, overflowing.
     Rats scatter upon Welles, arrival.

     Welles looks to make sure he&#39;s alone.  He starts tearing
     open GARBAGE BAGS.  Flies swarm.  One bag&#39;s filled with
     empty food containers and old newspapers.

     Welles tears open another bag, finds burnt out FLORESCENT
     LIGHTBULBS, digs out a handful of empty PHOTO PAPER
     PACKAGES, bottles of DEVELOPING CHEMICALS.  He pulls out a
     few MAGAZINES; Time, Newsweek, etc...

     The magazines are cut up, falling apart, with pictures
     chopped out from many pages.  Welles examines ADDRESS LABELS:

     &lt;b&gt;&quot;Dino Velvet/D.V. Films
      1204 Keller Street
      New York, NY 10049&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH, NYC STREETS -- NIGHT

     Welles is on the PHONE.  The city bustles past.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 What do you know about a guy called
                 Dino Velvet?  Dino Velvet Films?

     INT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY -- INTERCUT

     Max is on the phone by the register, ringing purchases.

                             MAX
                       (into phone)
                 Dino Velvet... yeah, he&#39;s like the
                 John Luc Godard of S+M flicks,
                 supposed to be a real weirdo.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 A weirdo making S+M films?  Who&#39;d
                 have thought it?

                             MAX
                       (into phone)
                 His stuff comes out of New York.
                 Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic
                 Hardcore.  Definitely not for the
                 squeamish.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 Specialty product.

                             MAX
                 You&#39;re learning.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 Where does he sell it?

                             MAX
                 Out of the back of bondage magazines
                 mostly, but you can find it on the
                 street if you look.  He&#39;ll also do
                 commissions, for enough money...

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

                             MAX (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Nothing illegal, it&#39;s always
                 borderline.  Like if some freak
                 wants to see a transvestite in a
                 full rubber immersion suit getting
                 an enema from a...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Alright, I get the picture.

                             MAX (V.O.)
                 He cuts all kinds of other stuff
                 into his movies; photographs,
                 newsreel footage, subliminal images.
                 Thinks he&#39;s making art.

                             WELLES 
                 Well, I&#39;m in New York now.  What do
                 you say to flying out and giving me
                 a hand?

                             MAX (V.O.)
                 I&#39;m a working stiff, pops.

                             WELLES
                 Take a vacation.  I&#39;ll pay you four
                 hundred a day, plus expenses.

                             MAX (V.O.)
                 You want me to come out there and
                 play private eye?

                             WELLES
                 Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up
                 whatever Dino Velvet films you can.
                 Get receipts.  I&#39;ll call back.

                             MAX (V.O.)
                 See ya.

     Welles hangs up, starts feeding quarters into the phone.

     INT.  MRS. CHRISTIAN&#39;S BEDROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     Mrs. Christian&#39;s in bed, pale and sickly.  The PHONE RINGS.
     Mrs. Christian reaches for it.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                       (into phone, weakly)
                 Hello?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                       (coughing)
                 How are you?  Having any luck?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 I don&#39;t know if luck&#39;s the word.
                 Are you feeling alright?

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 I&#39;ve been ordered into bed.  The
                 doctor says I&#39;ve gotten the flu, or
                 some other wretched ailment.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                 I hope it&#39;s nothing serious.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 Nothing more than a bother.  Have
                 you any news for me?

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 I&#39;ve made progress.  I&#39;m in
                 Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces
                 fall into place, I&#39;ll drive to you
                 and give you an update.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Fine...

     MRS. CHRISTIAN is HEARD COUGHING.  Welles waits.

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;ve got about five thousand left in
                 cash, but I&#39;ll need another thirty,
                 if you approve.

                             MRS CHRISTIAN
                 How will I get it to you?

                             WELLES
                 If you have a pencil and paper, I&#39;ll
                 tell you how to send it.


     EXT.  MOTEL, HELL&#39;S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     A TAXI pulls over in front of this flea-bag motel.  Max gets
     out with a SUITCASE, looks at the dubious accommodations.

     INT.  MOTEL, MAX&#39;S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Max enters with Welles, turns on a light and throws his
     suitcase on the bed.  The room is disgusting.

                             MAX
                 You didn&#39;t say it was gonna be this
                 luxurious.

                             WELLES
                 It&#39;s their Presidential Suite.

                             MAX
                 Great.

     Max looks in the bathroom.

                             MAX
                 Oh, come on, man, what are we doing
                 in this flea bag?

                             WELLES
                 It&#39;s cheap, and people know to mind
                 their own business. What have you
                 got for me? 

     Max opens his suitcase, takes out THREE VIDEO TAPES.

     He hands them to Welles.  The boxes are covered in jumbled
     PHOTO COLLAGES: American flag, S+M men and women, a skull,
     mannequins, a scorpion, cut-outs of arms, legs and eyeballs.

                             MAX
                 Dino Velvet.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles is lit by the flicker from the TELEVISION SCREEN.  WE
     SEE NOTHING.  We HEAR the rhythmic MUFFLED MOANS of a WOMAN
     from the TV, can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s pleasure or pain.

     Max is asleep in the bed, PIZZA BOX near his feet.

     Welles drinks beer, gets up and ejects the CASSETTE from a
     VCR, tosses it aside, tired.  He picks another Dino Velvet
     TAPE, puts it in, sits.

     ON TV: GOTHIC ROCK is HEARD over old, scratchy IMAGES: of
     Klansmen around a burning cross... Dracula menacing a
     sleeping woman... a man in a Devil costume dancing...

     Welles opens another beer.

     ON TV: a WOMAN is tied up, arms in the air, hanging from the
     ceiling, gagged and blindfolded, in a dungeon lit by
     candelabras.  Then, glimpsed IMAGES: worms writhing in
     slime... gargoyles... a guillotine falling.  Then, the bound
     woman, struggling.  A MASKED MAN in a leather jacket enters.
     He wears a LEATHER MASK with zipper eyes and mouth...

     This focuses Welles&#39; attention.

     ON TV: the Masked Man circles the captured woman...

                             WELLES
                 Max... wake up...

     Max awakens, rolling over, groggy.

                             MAX
                 Wha... ?

                             WELLES
                       (points at TV)
                 Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?

     Max tries to see, eyes barely open.

                             MAX
                 He&#39;s one of the lunatics Dino uses.
                 He&#39;s in a bunch of these.

     Welles watches.  On the TV, Masked Man takes off his jacket
     shirtless, reveals an impossibly muscled body.  Huge arms,
     thick chest, oiled, dotted in pimples. 

                             MAX
                 Why?  He have something to do with
                 whatever you&#39;re into?

     Still watching the behemoth on TV, Welles is less sure.

     ON TV: the bulging Masked Man flexes, ripped.

                             WELLES
                 No... it&#39;s nothing... that&#39;s not him.

     Welles rubs his eyes, sits back.  Max sits up, watching.

     ON TV: Masked Man pulls the bound woman&#39;s head back by her
     hair, licks her face with his thick tongue...

     CLOSE ON: Masked Man grips the woman&#39;s head, still licking.
     He pulls down the woman&#39;s blindfold...

     Welles sits forward, realizing, horrified...

     Welles goes to the VCR, hits PAUSE.  The IMAGE on TV
     FREEZES.  Welles goes back, FRAME by FRAME...

     ... to the CLOSE UP where Masked Man grips the woman&#39;s face.
     FREEZE FRAME.  On Masked Man&#39;s hand: a TATTOO, on the arch
     between his forefinger and thumb, same as the scrawny Masked
     Man in the snuff film.  A PENTAGRAM TATTOO.

                             WELLES
                 Who is he?

                             MAX
                 I told you, he&#39;s one of Dino
                 Velvet&#39;s stock players...

                             WELLES
                 Who is he, his &lt;u&gt;name&lt;/u&gt;?

                             MAX
                 Nobody knows his name.  That&#39;s his
                 thing.  He always wears a mask.  You
                 never see his face.  He calls
                 himself &quot;Machine,&quot; that&#39;s what they
                 call him.  Machine. 

     Welles hits PLAY.  On TV, Masked Man runs his hands up and
     down the woman&#39;s body.  The woman&#39;s eyes are filled with
     fear.  Welles sits, unnerved, watching.

                             MAX
                 They say he&#39;s half brain-dead from
                 all the steroids he&#39;s using.

     Max rolls over, trying to get back to sleep.

                             MAX
                 He&#39;s a brutal motherfucker, man.  He
                 loves what he does for a living. 


     INT.  WELLES&#39; MOTEL ROOM -- DAY

     Welles enters, carries an OVERNIGHT PACKAGE and his LOCK
     BOX.  At the desk, he tears open the package, opens the
     MANILA ENVELOPE inside; finds FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS in
     thousand dollar bills, wrapped in plastic and masking tape.

     Welles takes the lock box to the bed and works the
     combination, opens it.  He takes out the holster, stands
     looking down at the gun.  He puts the holster on.


     EXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     Welles&#39; Ford waits with turn signal on.  A car pulls out of
     a parking space.  Welles takes the space.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; CAR -- DAY

     Max is in the passenger seat.  Welles looks to 1204.

                             WELLES
                 You don&#39;t need to be here.

                             MAX
                 What kind of Junior P.I. would I be
                 if I didn&#39;t go with you?

     INT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, SECOND FLOOR -- DAY

     Welles and Max get off the elevator, moving down the grey
     hall, to the black doors.  Welles pushes the INTERCOM
     BUTTON.  After a moment, the INTERCOM CRACKLES...

                             MAN&#39;S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (from intercom)
                 Who is it?

     Welles waits, presses the button again.

     INT.  DINO VELVET STUDIO -- DAY

     The doors BUZZ and Welles and Max warily enter this large,
     dark, converted warehouse.  Square pillars shoot from floor
     to ceiling.  Shafts of light cut down from high windows.

     A large THUG in a pinstripe suit crosses from a far DESK.

                             THUG
                 You&#39;re in the wrong place.

                             WELLES
                 We&#39;re looking for Mr. Velvet.

                             THUG
                 He&#39;s not here. 

     Welles looks around, at piles of PROPS; a huge faux-stone
     ANGEL and GARGOYLES, elaborate CANDELABRAS, a huge BIRDCAGE,
     massive WOODEN CROSS, NAZI FLAGS.

                             WELLES
                 Why don&#39;t you tell him we&#39;re here to
                 give him a large sum of money.  If
                 he&#39;s not interested, we&#39;ll go.

                             THUG
                 You should leave now, before I have
                 to remove you.

     Welles just stands looking at the thug.  A VOICE is HEARD...

                             DINO VELVET&#39;S VOICE (V.O.)
                       (from SPEAKERS)
                 Show them in, Milo.

     Welles and Max look up.  There are SPEAKERS mounted high up
     on the pillars, and SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS looking down.

                             WELLES
                 You heard the boss, Milo.

     The disgruntled thug starts back across the studio towards
     a distant DOOR.  Welles and Max follow...

     They notice an elaborate set built in one corner, a TORTURE
     CHAMBER, complete with RACK and IRON MAIDEN.

     INT.  DINO VELVET&#39;S OFFICE -- DAY

     Thug opens the door and lets Welles and Max in.
     The office is huge, windowless walls covered in thousands of
     PICTURES from every conceivable source, torn and cut, pinned
     up to form an indecipherable collage.  A tall LADDER leans
     against one wall, near three TELEVISIONS.

     DINO VELVET rises behind his desk, a small, bird-like man,
     wearing a black suit and bad hairpiece.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Come in.  Make yourself comfortable.

     Welles shakes Dino&#39;s hand.  Max looks up at the walls.
     IMAGES; porn pictures, news photos, world leaders, autopsy
     photos, armies and insects, the naked and the dead.

                             WELLES
                 It&#39;s an honor to meet you.  Thank
                 you for seeing us.

                             DINO VELVET
                 What can I do for you today?

     Welles sits.  Shelves behind Dino&#39;s desk are piled high with
     VIDEO CASSETTES, old MOVIE CAMERAS, big REELS of 16mm FILM.
     VIDEOS and MAGAZINES are stacked everywhere.

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;d like to commission a work.  I&#39;m
                 a great admirer of yours.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Flattering.  And, who&#39;s your
                 colorful little chum?

                             WELLES
                 A fellow investor.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Hmm.

                             MAX
                 You&#39;re the only one still shooting
                 film and transferring it to video.
                 Nobody appreciates that kind of
                 integrity anymore... the grain, the
                 gritty look you get.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Well, I&#39;m glad you appreciate it.
                       (to Welles)
                 What would you say is your favorite
                 piece?

     Welles considers.  Max glances over, looks back to the walls.

                             MAX
                 I know if I had to pick, it&#39;d be
                 &quot;Choke,&quot; or &quot;Devil.&quot;

                             WELLES
                 &quot;Devil&quot; frightened me as much as it
                 excited me, but I&#39;d be hard pressed
                 to choose a favorite.

     Dino grins, showing yellowed teeth.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You said something about money.

                             WELLES
                 Yes.  What we&#39;re looking for is
                 rather specific.

     Welles takes out an ENVELOPE, puts it on the desk.

                             WELLES
                 That&#39;s five thousand dollars.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Is it?

                             WELLES
                 Five thousand now, five thousand on
                 delivery. 
                 Two women, one white and one black,
                 as long as they have large breasts.
                 Hard bondage, or course.  Other than
                 that, trusting your artistic
                 interpretation, I have only two
                 stipulations.

                             DINO VELVET
                 And they are?

                             WELLES
                 I want to watch you work.

                             DINO VELVET
                 I&#39;ll consider it.

                             WELLES
                 And the other performer... it has to
                 be that monster you use... the man
                 in the mask.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Machine.

                             WELLES
                 If it&#39;s not him, there&#39;s no deal.

     Dino drums his painted fingernails on his lips.

                             DINO VELVET
                 He might be interested... but it
                 would mean another five thousand.

                             WELLES
                 We can do that.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Well, well, I&#39;ll have to put my
                 thinking-cap on about all this.
                 You&#39;ll leave the money as a deposit?
                       (off Welles&#39; nod)
                 Very good.

     Dino stands, picks up a still CAMERA off his desk and comes
     to look at Welles, studying him.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You have a beautiful face... the way
                 the light hits it.  I&#39;d like to take
                 your picture.  You don&#39;t mind?

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;d rather you didn&#39;t.

                             DINO VELVET
                 What&#39;s the problem? 

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;m camera shy.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You trust me to keep your money, but
                 not to take your picture?

                             WELLES
                 Those are two different kinds of
                 trust.
                       (stands)
                 Thank you for your time.  I hope we
                 can do business.

     Welles leaves.  Max goes with him.  Dino watches them leave.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN STREET -- NIGHT

     HORNS BLARE.  TWO CARS have collided head-on.  A large CROWD
     gathers.  One windshield&#39;s shattered, blood spattered.  The
     driver is slumped over the wheel, gushing blood.

     On a nearby street corner, Welles in on a PAY PHONE.
     HEAVY METAL can be HEARD filtered through the receiver.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 So, what do you say?

     INT.  DINO VELVET&#39;S OFFICE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     Dino&#39;s stands in the middle of his office, naked, his back
     to us, 8MM camera in hand, on the phone.  A NAKED WOMAN
     dances for Dino.  A Heavy Metal MUSIC VIDEO plays on a TV.

                             DINO VELVET
                       (into phone)
                 I&#39;ll do this for you.  Fifteen
                 thousand dollars.

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Machine&#39;s in?

                             DINO VELVET
                       (into phone)
                 He&#39;s in.  It will be his pleasure.

     INT.  PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

                             DINO VELVET (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Be at 366 Hoyt Avenue, three
                 o&#39;clock, tomorrow.

     Welles digs out his notepad, writing. 

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Where&#39;s that?

                             DINO VELVET (V.O.)
                 Brooklyn.  Don&#39;t be late.


     EXT.  MOTEL COURTYARD, POOL -- NIGHT

     HORNS and TRAFFIC are HEARD.  Max and Welles sit in lawn
     chairs at the tiny pool.  Welles smokes.  Max drinks beer.
     They watch an ELDERLY WOMAN in a one piece bathing suit
     climb from the pool and walk to the diving board, diving in.

                             MAX
                 What&#39;s next?

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;m trying to figure that out
                 myself.  I have to see Machine
                 without his mask.

                             MAX
                 Still don&#39;t want to tell me what
                 you&#39;re doing?

                             WELLES
                 Nope.

     The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board.
     Welles takes out a thick ENVELOPE, hands it to Max.

                             WELLES
                 This is for you.

     Max doesn&#39;t understand, opens the envelope, finds about
     fifteen thousand dollars in the envelope.

                             MAX
                 What&#39;s this?

                             WELLES
                 It&#39;s money.  People use it to
                 purchase goods and services.

     Max looks at it again, can&#39;t believe it.

                             MAX
                 Look... that&#39;s awful generous and
                 everything...

                             WELLES
                 It&#39;s not my money.  The woman I got
                 it from is never going to give it a
                 second thought.  Let&#39;s not make a
                 big deal out of this, okay? 
                       (pause)
                 Go be a race car driver.  Go run for
                 President.  Whatever.

     Welles puts his cigarette out, stands.

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;ll see you around.

     Welles walks away, heading to his room.  Max watches him go,
     doesn&#39;t know what to say, looks in the envelope.

     The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board.


     EXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS -- DAY

     A deserted, war zone neighborhood of abandoned, graffittied
     buildings.  A few burnt out cars on the street.  Welles
     drives through, watchful.

     Welles drives past a huge TWO-STORY WAREHOUSE, does a u-turn.
     He parks the car.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; CAR -- DAY

     Welles checks his gun, returns it to his holster.

     EXT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     Welles climbs crumbling concrete stairs, looking all
     directions, crossing a LOADING DOCK towards a DOOR...

     INT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     Welles enters slowly, trying to get his eyes to adjust to
     the darkness.  A vast, empty space looms before him.

     In the middle of the warehouse, Dino Velvet stands, in a
     powder blue suit, holding an archery BOW and ARROW.

                             DINO VELVET
                 There you are.  Come join us.

     There&#39;s a wrought IRON BED not far from Dino.  MACHINE is
     seated on the mattress, a huge man, wearing a leather S+M
     harness and the same WRESTLING MASK as in the snuff film.

     Welles gathers his courage, walks towards them.

     Dino pulls back on the bow, aiming away across the
     warehouse.  He stands by a TABLE with a QUIVER of ARROWS
     propped up.  He shoots an arrow toward a large TARGET...

     Strikes the target dead center, BULL&#39;S-EYE.  As Welles gets
     closer, he notices several things ... 

     ... a 16MM CAMERA mounted on a TRIPOD, facing the bed, along
     with several movie LIGHTS

     ... several BOWIE KNIFES are laid out on the table, beside
     a pair of HANDCUFFS...

     ... Machine is watching him as he approaches...

     Welles stops, not far from Dino and Machine, but keeping his
     distance.  Dino&#39;s still firing arrows at the target.
     Machine&#39;s still staring at Welles.

                             WELLES
                       (to Machine)
                 Hello.

     Machine just stares at him with bloodshot eyes.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You brought the money?

                             WELLES
                       (takes out envelope)
                 Right here.

     Dino lets fly another arrow... another bull&#39;s-eye, then
     turns to look at Welles with a smile.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Excellent.

                             WELLES
                 Where are the women?

                             DINO VELVET
                 They should be here any minute.

     Welles comes forward slowly, places the envelope on the
     table, beside Bowie knifes.  He&#39;s sweating.

                             WELLES
                       (of the knifes)
                 What are these for?

                             DINO VELVET
                 Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They&#39;re just
                 props.  Nice, aren&#39;t they?

                             WELLES
                 Sure.

     Dino walks across towards the target.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Machine and I were just talking
                 about knifes.  The beauty of
                 knifes...

     Dino pulls arrows from the target.

                             DINO VELVET
                 He was saying how fascinated he is
                 by their simple ability to be sharp.
                 The ability of a piece of metal to
                 be so thin that it is almost
                 nothing...

     Dino walks back to the table, replaces the arrows in the
     quiver, cueing another arrow in is bow.

                             DINO VELVET
                 So close to nothingness that it cuts
                 with minimum effort, because it&#39;s so
                 non-intrusive.  Flesh is fooled.  It
                 blooms open as the blade widens, but
                 by then it&#39;s too late, because the
                 knife&#39;s already doing its pure,
                 simple damage.

     Dino shoots another arrow to the target.
     A CLATTER attracts Welles attention.  Far across the
     warehouse, a DELIVERY DOOR rolls upwards.  A CAR with tinted
     windows drives in...

     The MAN who opened the door, silhouetted in sunlight, stays
     behind to close the door as the car pulls forward...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Ah, ours guests have arrived.

     Machine stands.  He is a giant.
     Welles takes a few steps back, wary, sweating hard now.

     The car parks across the warehouse, not far from the target.

     Dino puts another arrow in his bow, pulls it taunt, aims at
     the target... turns, aims the arrow at Welles.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Mister Welles... would you be so
                 kind as to remove any firearms from
                 your person?

                             WELLES
                 What are you... ?

                             DINO VELVET
                 Take out your gun!

     Welles brings his hand towards his holster...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Slowly.  Let me see it.

     Welles takes out his gun, looks across the warehouse...

     The SILHOUETTED MAN is walking this way.  Can&#39;t tell who he
     is yet.  Machine heads the direction of the parked car.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Empty the gun onto the table, very
                 carefully.

                             WELLES
                 Look, I don&#39;t know what this...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say,
                 or I&#39;ll put this arrow through your
                 throat.

     Welles obeys, helpless, dumps the bullets out on the table.

     The SILHOUETTED MAN&#39;S getting closer.  It&#39;s Eddie Poole.

                             EDDIE
                 Is that him?

                             DINO VELVET
                       (to Welles)
                 Put the gun down, take the
                 handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the
                 bed.

     Welles obeys, walks to the bed.
     Welles attaches one cuff to the bed&#39;s iron rail, fastens the
     other cuff around his wrist. Dino puts down the bow and arrow.

                             DINO VELVET
                       (still to Welles)
                 Didn&#39;t know what to make of you at
                 first, and you certainly had Eddie
                 on pins and needles.  But, lo and
                 behold, from out of the blue came an
                 old business acquaintance to explain
                 everything...

     Welles looks across to the car...
     The sinister lawyer, Longdale, gets out from behind the
     wheel and hands the keys to Machine, walks this way...

                             EDDIE
                 This is the fucker?  Motherfucker,
                 doesn&#39;t look like anything...

     Eddie walks around the bed, studies Welles.  Welles watches
     him.  Eddie goes to stand behind Welles, rushes forward...

     PUNCHES Welles in the side of the head.
     Welles goes down, clutching his face.

                             EDDIE
                 Doesn&#39;t look like shit.

     Eddie pulls Welles to his feet, throws him against the bed,
     frisking him from head to toe.

     Longdale comes to stand beside Dino, nervous, taking out a
     tiny HANDGUN and pointing it at Welles.  Welles looks up,
     holding his head, afraid, sits on the bed.

                             DINO VELVET
                     (to Welles)
                 You remember Mr. Longdale, don&#39;t you?

                             WELLES
                 I remember him.

                             LONGDALE
                 Let&#39;s get this over with.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Fine idea.

     Dino comes to sit on the bed beside Welles.

                             DINO VELVET
                 You&#39;re going to go get the film you
                 received from Mrs. Christian, bring
                 it here and put it in my hand.  And
                 to save time, so we make this as
                 efficient as possible, there&#39;s an
                 incentive...

     Dino puts his fingers in his mouth, lets out a sharp WHISTLE.

     Across the warehouse, Machine uses the car keys to open the
     trunk of the car, pulls SOMEONE out...

     It&#39;s Max, beaten bloody, bound, face swollen, gagged, hardly
     conscious.  Machine throws him to the floor.

                             WELLES
                 No...

     Welles tries to go towards Max, yanked back by the
     handcuffs, pulls the bed a few inches, but it&#39;s heavy.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Friend of yours?

                             WELLES
                 Look, he&#39;s got nothing to do with
                 this... let him go...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Can you guess what I&#39;m going to say
                 next?

                             WELLES
                 He doesn&#39;t know anything... he&#39;s got
                 nothing to do with this...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Bring the film, or we kill him.

     Sorrow and rage rises up in Welles, but there&#39;s no choice.

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;ll get it.  It&#39;s in a safe deposit
                 box, in the city...

                             DINO VELVET
                 How cooperative.  Longdale will keep
                 you company.

     Dino takes out HANDCUFF KEYS, throws them to Longdale.
     Longdale approaches Welles carefully, unlocking him.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Don&#39;t let Longdale&#39;s questionable
                 choice of weapon give you any ideas.
                 If his fey little gun puts enough
                 little holes in you, you&#39;ll be just
                 as dead... and so will Max.

                             EDDIE
                 Move it, dirtbag... !

     Eddie comes to SHOVE Welles.  Welles stumbles to the
     ground, gets to his feet.  Welles walks, takes one last
     glance back towards Max.  Longdale follows.

                             DINO VELVET
                       (watching them go)
                 Do hurry.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN STREETS -- DAY

     Welles&#39; car moves in the slow flow of traffic into mid-town.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; CAR -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles is at the wheel.  Longdale is in the passenger seat,
     gun held in his lap.

                             WELLES
                 You were the middleman, am I right?
                 Old man Christian wasn&#39;t about to go
                 shopping for a snuff film himself.

                             LONGDALE
                 Wouldn&#39;t exactly have been possible
                 for a man of his stature.

                             WELLES
                 So, he sent you, gave you the money,
                 his errand-boy.  And if you refused,
                 it wasn&#39;t like you could tell anyone
                 your pervert boss just asked you to
                 get him a snuff film.  That&#39;s the
                 beauty of lawyer/client privilege.

                             LONGDALE
                 That&#39;s trust.  Mr. Christian trusted
                 me implicitly.

                             WELLES
                 Must have paid you a lot, for you to
                 risk everything.  Would&#39;ve had to
                 have cut yourself a real nice piece
                 of money.

                             LONGDALE
                 I was well compensated.

                             WELLES
                 That&#39;s why you got scared when Mrs.
                 Christian hired me.  You knew about
                 the film, figured it had to be in
                 that safe.  How&#39;d you find me?

                             LONGDALE
                 Never mind how I found you.

                             WELLES
                 Followed me... must have freaked out
                 when you saw me closing in on your
                 buddies...

                             LONGDALE
                 They&#39;re no friends of mine.

                             WELLES
                 Except, you&#39;re willing commit murder
                 with them.

                             LONGDALE
                 None of this would be happening if
                 you would have left it alone.  If
                 you weren&#39;t digging up a girl who
                 died six years ago.  A girl no one
                 even remembers.

                             WELLES
                 Mary Anne Mathews, that was her
                 name.  Her mom remembers her.

     Welles looks at Longdale.

                             WELLES
                 You found these smut dealers and
                 asked to buy a snuff film, right?
                 Wanted them to find you one.  Well,
                 they didn&#39;t &lt;u&gt;find&lt;/u&gt; you one, Longdale,
                 they went out and &lt;u&gt;made&lt;/u&gt; you one...

                             LONGDALE
                 Shut up.

                             WELLES
                 Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you
                 paid money to have her murdered.

                             LONGDALE
                 Shut your mouth and drive!

                             WELLES
                 Did it get him off, huh, watching
                 them cut her up?  Tell me, because
                 I really want to understand.  Did he
                 jerk off to it?  You watch it with
                 him, sit there giving him a handjob
                 while you both watched... ?

     Longdale jams the gun against Welles&#39; side.

                             LONGDALE 
                 You&#39;re making me very angry.

                             WELLES
                 Just tell me.  Tell me some more of
                 the secrets you and Christian
                 shared. What kind of degenerate
                 pervert was he really?  What the
                 fuck did he want with a snuff film?

                             LONGDALE
                 You&#39;re asking me why?

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;m asking.

     Longdale sits back, wipes sweat from his face.

                             LONGDALE
                 A man like Mr. Christian, a great
                 man... all his money, all his
                 power... a man who attained
                 everything there was to attain...

                             WELLES
                 Why did he buy a film of some poor,
                 lost girl getting butchered?

                             LONGDALE
                 Isn&#39;t it incredibly obvious?

                             WELLES
                 Enlighten me.

                             LONGDALE
                 Because he could.  He did it because
                 he could.
                       (pause)
                 What other reason were you looking
                 for?

     Welles tightens his grip on the wheel, numbed. 


     EXT.  CHASE MANHATTAN BANK -- DAY

     Welles double parks, puts his hazard lights on.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; CAR -- CONTINUOUS

     Longdale sits forward, looks to the bank.

                             LONGDALE
                 You&#39;ve got four minutes till I call
                 Mr. Velvet and let him know there&#39;s
                 a problem.

     Longdale takes a CELLULAR PHONE from his pocket, shows it.
     Welles climbs out, heading to the bank...

     INT.  BANK, SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT -- DAY

     Welles and the SAFE DEPOSIT MANAGER enter.  They go to put
     their KEYS in one drawer, unlocking it a pulling it out.

                             MANAGER
                 May I show you to a booth...

                             WELLES
                 No, I&#39;ve got it.

     Welles pulls the drawer open, takes the 8MM film out and
     hands the empty drawer to the manager, exiting.

     INT.  BANK -- DAY

     Welles comes out from the SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT, pocketing the
     film, crossing towards the entrance, looking around...

     ... at other CUSTOMERS waiting on line...

     ... at a GUARD with a GUN at his side...

     Welles detours, toward one of the LOAN DESKS.  The BANK
     EMPLOYEE behind the desk is occupied, on the phone.

     As Welles moves past the desk, he grabs a PAIR of SCISSORS
     from a pencil holder and palms it, heading to the door...

     INT.  WELLES&#39; CAR -- DAY

     Welles gets behind the wheel.  Longdale looks at his watch.

                             LONGDALE
                 You almost went over your limit.

                             WELLES
                 Fuck you.

     Welles puts the car in gear and drives. 

                             LONGDALE
                 Give me the film.

                             WELLES 
                 You&#39;ll get it when we get there.

     Longdale puts the gun to the side of Welles&#39; head.

                             LONGDALE
                 Give me the film.

                             WELLES
                 Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try
                 driving to Brooklyn with my brains
                 all over the windshield.

     Welles keeps driving.  Longdale sits back, stewing.


     INT.  WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     The door is kicked open.  Welles enters, takes the 8MM FILM
     out and holds it in his hand.  Longdale follows.

     As Welles moves forward, his face goes slack...

     Machine is seated on the bed, Eddie and Dino stand smoking
     cigarettes, and further on, &lt;u&gt;Max is tied to the target,&lt;/u&gt;
     &lt;u&gt;slumped over, three arrows in his chest&lt;/u&gt;.  Dead.

                             WELLES
                 No!!

     Welles runs towards Max, crying out, tears in his eyes...

     Machine rises, goes to intercept Welles, grabbing him.
     Welles tries to break free, but Machine lifts Welles up and
     throws him brutally to the ground.

     Welles scrambles to get up...

                             WELLES
                 You fuckers!

     Eddie comes to KICK Welles in the face.
     Welles is sent sprawling, blood gushing from his nose.  He
     lays there, stunned, weeping.

     Eddie pries the 8MM FILM from Welles&#39; hand, tosses it...

     Dino catches the film.

     Machine comes to drag Welles towards the bed.

     Dino unspools the film, holding it up to examine it.

     Machine handcuffs Welles to the metal bedframe.  Welles
     falls to his knees, holding his face.
     Eddie PUNCHES Welles in the head.

                             EDDIE
                 You&#39;re a dead man.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Leave him alone.

                             EDDIE
                 Fuck off.

     Eddie PUNCHES Welles in the kidney.  Welles tries to protect
     himself.  Eddie raises his fist to punch again, but Machine
     catches Eddie&#39;s fist, throws Eddie back...

                             EDDIE
                 What the fuck... !

                             DINO
                 I promised him to Machine.

     Eddie looks up at Machine, who towers over him.

                             EDDIE
                 ... sorry...

                             DINO VELVET
                 First things first.  You might want
                 to watch this, Mr. Welles...

     Welles looks up through tears...
     Dino drops the 8MM FILM on the floor, takes a small bottle
     of lighter fluid from his pocket.  Longdale comes to watch.

     Welles watches helpless, agonizing...

                             WELLES
                 Don&#39;t... please...

     Dino drops the film to the floor, sprays it with fluid,
     takes out matches, light one, drops it...

     The 8MM FILM goes up in flame...

     Welles watches, quaking, hysterical, trying to pull himself
     towards the flame, dragging the bed...

     The film is destroyed by flame...

     Welles gives up, presses his face to the floor, eyes shut.

                             DINO VELVET
                 And so it ends.  It&#39;s as if she
                 never existed.

     Welles falls back, gasping, wiping blood and tears and
     spittle from his face, getting slowly, to his feet.

                             DINO VELVET
                 Don&#39;t blame yourself.  You were in
                 way over your head.

     He looks to Max&#39;s corpse, to the smoldering film...
     Swallowing back his fear, panic and rage...

                             WELLES
                 Motherfuckers.  Small time,
                 motherfuckers... !  Tell me
                 something...

     Welles spits blood, hangs onto the bed for support.

                             WELLES
                 I know why you did it, Dino,
                 Eddie... but, why&#39;d the lawyer do
                 it?  Must have been a helluva lot of
                 money, right?  One fuckload of
                 money...

     Welles sits on the bed, eyes burning with fury.

                             WELLES
                 So, what are you all still doing
                 small time, huh?  What are you still
                 doing in the sewer, Eddie?!
                 Christian gave Longdale a million
                 dollars to find him a snuff film.
                 How much did you ever see... ?

     Eddie and Dino look to Longdale.

                             EDDIE
                 What&#39;s he talking about?

                             WELLES
                 One million dollars, Dino.  How much
                 did he tell you he had...

     Longdale&#39;s getting very nervous.

                             LONGDALE
                 He&#39;s lying.

                             WELLES
                 Look at him.  You think he played it
                 square?  How much did he give you,
                 how much did he keep for himself?

     Eddie walks towards Longdale...

                             EDDIE
                 What the fuck&#39;s he talking about?

     Longdale takes out his gun, aims it at Machine, Dino and
     Eddie, scared...

                             LONGDALE
                 Stay away from me. 

                             DINO VELVET
                 What&#39;s going on, Longdale?  Did this
                 happen?

                             EDDIE
                 You sell us short, you fuck?

                             LONGDALE
                 Stay back!  You have a gun, Eddie,
                 show it to me.  Now!

     Eddie slowly takes out his gun, seething.

                             LONGDALE
                 Put it on the ground, kick it here...

     Eddie puts the gun down, kicks it...
     Longdale picks it up, throws it far away.

                             EDDIE
                 You fucking lawyer...

                             LONGDALE
                 Move back!  All of you... move!

     Machine, Dino and Eddie stand between Longdale and the car
     with tinted windows parked across the warehouse...

                             DINO VELVET
                 What were you thinking?

     Welles watches as Machine, Dino and Eddie back slowly away
     from Longdale.  Longdale&#39;s gun hand is shaky...

     Welles tries to drag himself towards the table where his gun
     and bullets are, dragging the bed, inch by inch...

     Longdale back away, trying to angle around the menacing trio
     so he can get to the car...

                             LONGDALE
                 Back off!  Everything&#39;s been taken
                 care of, and I&#39;m leaving now...

                             DINO VELVET
                 You&#39;re not going anywhere if you
                 fucked us, lawyer.

                             LONGDALE
                 I&#39;m leaving.

                             EDDIE
                 You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna
                 kill us all, is that it?

                             DINO VELVET
                 You betrayed us.

                             LONGDALE
                 Stay where you are!

     Machine edges forward, holding his hands in the air.
     Longdale brandishes the gun...

                             LONGDALE
                 Keep back!

     Machine, Eddie and Dino are held at bay...

                             DINO VELVET
                 You&#39;re not gonna live through this.

     Welles still tries to get to the table, wrist bleeding in
     the cuff, bed screeching across the floor...

     Machine, hands up, slowly reaches behind his shoulder,
     touches the handle of a huge KNIFE sheathed to his back.

                             LONGDALE
                 Our business is done, I&#39;m leaving,
                 no one&#39;s going to stop me...

     Longdale glances towards the car, seems like he&#39;s about to
     make a run for it.  Dino Velvet takes a step forward...

                             DINO VELVET
                 Fuck you!

     Machine unsheathes the KNIFE and THROWS...

     THUNK!  The knife imbeds to the hilt in Longdale&#39;s chest and
     Longdale&#39;s gun FIRES...

     Dino Velvet flies backwards, shot in the face!

     Dino hits the ground, screaming, writhing, hands to his
     face, blood pouring out between his fingers.

     Longdale falls back onto his ass, sitting there, eyes bugged
     out in surprise.  He looks down at the knife in his chest.

     Machine lets out a SCREAM, runs to Dino...

     Machine falls to his knees and grips Dino, tries to hold
     him.  Dino&#39;s screaming, squirming frantically...

     Longdale sits looking down at the knife in his chest, looks
     up, and gallons of blood pour from his mouth...

                             EDDIE
                 Fuck.

     Eddie comes to look down at the Longdale.  Longdale falls
     back, dead, blood still flowing from his maw.

     Welles drags the heavy bed, getting closer to the table...

     Eddie spins, looks across to see Welles struggling...

     Dino breaks free from Machine, runs blindly, still holding
     his gushing face, falls, tries to get back up...

     Eddie runs towards Welles.

     Dino stumbles forwards, writhing, then suddenly lays still.

     Machine rises, looking at Dino.  Tears come out from
     Machine&#39;s eyes and roll down his mask.

     One last gasp and shudder from Dino&#39;s body; death rattle.

     Welles pulls the bed, practically pulling his arm from the
     socket, desperately clawing towards the table...
     The table is mere feet away...

     Eddie arrives, KICK Welles in the ribs...

     Welles recoils.  Eddies KICKS again.  Welles curls into a
     ball.  Eddie KICKS again...

                             MACHINE (O.S.)
                 NO!

     Eddie stops, looks to Machine.

                             MACHINE
                 He&#39;s mine!

     Machine strides over the Longdale&#39;s corpse, puts his foot on
     Longdale&#39;s chest, yanks out the knife...
     Machine starts this way...

     Eddie backs from Welles.  Welles looks up, trying to shake
     off unconsciousness, sees Machine coming...

     Welles bows down, on his knees, as if to accept his fate...
     Reaching his free hand into his suit pocket...

                             WELLES
                 No, no, no... please, don&#39;t kill
                 me... please... !

     Machine arrives, knife in hand, lifts Welles&#39; head back by
     the hair, brings the knife hand back...

                             EDDIE
                 Do him good.

     Welles rises suddenly, arm shooting forward, STABBING
     SCISSORS deep in Machine stomach...

     Machine ROARS, falling back, pitching forward...

     Machine&#39;s knife clatters to the ground.

     Eddie&#39;s eyes go wide. 

     Machine hits the floor, clutching his guts.

     Welles pushes upwards with all he&#39;s got left, turns the iron
     bedframe onto its side, flipping the mattress off...

     Eddie moves forward, furious...

     Welles grabs Machine&#39;s knife, wielding it, holding Eddie off.

                             WELLES
                 Back off, Eddie...

     Welles drags the now lightened bed frame towards the table.
     Eddie&#39;s sorely tempted, but keeps away.

     Eddie turns, looks across the warehouse...

     There&#39;s his gun, lying there, far away.

     Eddie runs for the gun.

     Welles pulls himself to the table, reaches for the gun,
     knocks the table over.  He&#39;s got the gun, but...

     Bullets hit the floor as the table falls.

     Welles struggles to open his gun with his sole free hand,
     gets it open, holds it between his knees...

     Welles grabs a bullet...

     Eddie&#39;s running toward his gun, gasping for air...

     Machine&#39;s on his knees, pulling the scissors out with
     trembling hands...

     Welles puts the bullet in the gun, flips it shut, rises,
     taking aim across the warehouse...

                             WELLES
                 Stop Eddie!

     Eddie&#39;s running...

                             WELLES
                       (pulls back the hammer)
                 I swear to Christ I&#39;ll shoot you in
                 the back... !

     Eddie stops, hands up, about ten feet from his gun...

     Machine stays on his knees, holding his bleeding stomach.
     Welles points his gun at Machine.

                             WELLES
                 Come back, or I put a hole in him.

     Eddie&#39;s looking at his gun, so close, so far away.

                             WELLES
                 You might make it to your gun, but
                 not before I shoot Machine.  And if
                 I have to shoot him because of you,
                 and I don&#39;t kill him, right after he
                 kills me, he&#39;s gonna kill you.

     Eddie turns, starts walking back...

                             WELLES
                       (to Machine)
                 Take off the mask.

     Machine shakes his head.

                             WELLES
                 Take it off!

                             MACHINE
                 You got one bullet.

     Welles looks to see Eddie heading back, keeps the gun on
     Machine, backs away, dragging the bed frame, looks to the
     DOOR behind him...

                             MACHINE
                 The only choice you have now, is
                 which one of us kills you.

     Welles backs away, drags the bedframe.  Eddie&#39;s getting
     close.  Welles points the gun at Eddie.  Eddie slows.

     Welles points the gun at Machine, points the gun at Eddie.

     Welles puts the gun to the chain of his handcuffs, FIRES...
     breaks the handcuff chain.

     Welles bolts to the door...

                             MACHINE
                 Get the gun!

     Eddie runs back towards his gun.
     Machine rises with a grunt of pain, moves towards the door,
     but agony doubles him back over to his knees.

     EXT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY

     Welles shoves out into daylight, fleeing down the stairs,
     running towards his car...

     INT.  WELLES&#39; CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

     Welles climbs in, gets out his keys, starts the car...
     He pulls away, TIRES SCREECHING.  Behind, Eddie gives chase,
     running, FIRING his gun...

     Welles ducks as BULLETS SLAM the car, SHATTERING WINDOWS.

     EXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

     Welles&#39; car picks up speed, takes a turn, BURNING RUBBER...
     Behind, Eddie curses, runs back to the warehouse.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

     Welles glances back, ENGINE ROARING.  He tries to keep from
     crying, steers with one hand, holds his bleeding face.

     EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

     Welles&#39; car races away.


     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY

     Amy looks tired, like she hasn&#39;t slept.  She feeds Cindy.
     PHONE RINGS.  Amy goes to answer it...

                             AMY
                       (into phone)
                 Hello?

                             WELLES (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Amy, it&#39;s me.  Listen very
                 carefully..

                             AMY
                       (into phone)
                 Tom?  Where have you been... ?

     INT.  WELLES&#39; CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

     Welles drives, face caked in dried blood, cellular phone to
     his ear.  The HIGHWAY rushes past out the car window.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and
                 get out of the house.  Do it now.
                 Go to a hotel and stay there...

                             AMY (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 What&#39;s wrong?  Are you alright?

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 I&#39;m okay.  Please, honey, I can&#39;t
                 explain.  Don&#39;t use the phone, just
                 pack a bag and get out.  I&#39;m on my
                 way.  I&#39;ll be back at the house in
                 three hours.  Call me from the hotel
                 when you get there

                             AMY (V.O.)
                 ... What&#39;s going on?

                             WELLES
                 Just do it, Amy, please, go.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

     Amy hangs up, scared.  She goes to grab Cindy up into her
     arms, hurrying out of the kitchen and going upstairs.

     EXT.  HIGHWAY -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

     Welles&#39; car tears down the freeway, passing other cars.


     EXT.  WELLES&#39; NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHT

     Suburban streets.  Welles&#39; car arrives, parks.  Welles gets
     out, starts across a neighbor&#39;s yard, cuts between houses...

     EXT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, BACKYARD -- NIGHT

     Welles enters his backyard, slowing, taking out his gun.  He
     keeps behind shrubbery, surveying his dark house.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, DOWNSTAIRS LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles uses a key to unlock the SLIDING GLASS DOOR, opens it
     slow, enters, gun up, searching the darkness.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT

     Welles pushes the door open, checks this room.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles makes sure the bedroom&#39;s empty, looks in the
     bathroom.  He puts his gun away, leaves the lights off.

     He goes to the PHONE on the bedside table, unscrews the
     earpiece.  He removes a small, wire-mesh BUGGING DEVICE.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Dark.  Welles picks up the cordless phone, struggles to pry
     the receiver open.  He discovers another small BUG.

     He drops the BUGS to the floor, crushes them under foot.

     He puts the phone back together and is replacing it when it
     RINGS LOUDLY.  Welles is startled, drops the phone...

     Welles takes a breath, trying to shake off the jitters.  He
     picks up the RINGING PHONE, answers it...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Honey... ?

                             MACHINE (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Not quite.

     Welles stiffens.

                             MACHINE (V.O.)
                 Nothing like getting home after a
                 rough day.  Home sweet home.

     Welles moves into the HALL, towards the front door...

                             MACHINE (V.O.)
                 Walk away.  Pack your bags, put the
                 wife and kid in the car and find a
                 place to hide.  If you&#39;re lucky,
                 you&#39;ll never see me again.

     Welles takes out his gun, opens the front door, looking out.
     The street in front of the house is empty.  CRICKETS CHIRP.

                             WELLES
                 I don&#39;t know if I can do that.

                             MACHINE (V.O.)
                 I know who you are.  I know where
                 you live.  I know everything I need
                 to know to find you.
                       (pause)
                 Who am I?

     MACHINE is HEARD HANGING UP the phone.


     INT.  HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Cindy&#39;s crying.  Amy opens the door with the chain on, sees
     Welles, lets him in.  Amy and Welles embrace, kissing.  Amy
     touches Welles damaged face, worried...

                             AMY
                 What happened to you?

                             WELLES 
                 I&#39;m okay, honey, I&#39;m okay.  Are you
                 alright?

                             AMY
                 What&#39;s going on, Tom?  What happened?

                             WELLES
                 I can&#39;t tell you, Amy.  You know I
                 can&#39;t.  You have to trust me...

                             AMY
                 Tom...

                             WELLES 
                 It has to be this way for now.  It
                 won&#39;t be long.

     Welles goes to pick up Cindy, tries to comfort her, kisses
     her red face as she keeps crying.

                             AMY
                 Why haven&#39;t you called?  Why don&#39;t
                 you answer your phone?

                             WELLES
                 I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m sorry...

                             AMY
                 You&#39;re sorry?  What was I supposed
                 to think?

     Amy comes to take Cindy from him.

                             AMY
                 You owe me an explanation.  You
                 can&#39;t treat me like this.

                             WELLES
                 I wanted to call.  I couldn&#39;t.

                             AMY
                 You couldn&#39;t?

                             WELLES
                 You don&#39;t understand...

                             AMY
                 No, I don&#39;t, because you&#39;re not
                 telling me anything!

                             WELLES
                 I was in hell.  If I called you...
                 if I heard your voice... it would
                 have been so easy for me to quit.
                 I couldn&#39;t do that.

     Tears comes to Amy&#39;s eyes.

                             AMY
                 You should have.

                             WELLES
                 Amy, I&#39;m not going to let anything
                 happen to us.

                             AMY
                 Look where we are.  Look at
                 yourself.  You son of a bitch,
                 you don&#39;t have any idea what
                 you&#39;re putting me through...

                             WELLES
                 I don&#39;t know what to say

                             AMY
                 You&#39;re killing me...

                             WELLES
                 Don&#39;t...

                             AMY
                 What was I supposed to think
                 happened to you?!

                             WELLES
                 Amy...

     Welles goes to Amy, but she pulls away.  She sits on the
     bed.  Cindy&#39;s still crying.  Welles sits beside Amy, puts
     her arms around her.

                             WELLES
                 Forgive me.

     Amy cradles Cindy.  Welles rests his head on Amy&#39;s shoulder,
     places one hand on Cindy.

                             WELLES
                 We have to stay here a few days.
                 I&#39;ll get more clothing from the
                 house if I can.  I&#39;m sorry.
                       (pause)
                 We&#39;re going to be okay.

     Welles rises.  He goes to the PHONE, starts dialing.  Amy
     looks at him, wipes tears.

                             AMY
                 Who are you calling?

                             WELLES
                 Mrs. Christian.

                             AMY
                 What?

                             WELLES
                 She&#39;s all I&#39;ve got.  She&#39;s the only
                 witness.

                             AMY
                 Tom... she&#39;s dead.

     Welles looks to Amy.

                             AMY 
                 She died in her sleep three days
                 ago.  It was in the paper...

                             WELLES
                 I just talked to her.

     Cindy&#39;s crying.  Welles sits into a chair, trying to
     understand this, his mind racing.  He hangs up the phone.

                             AMY
                 How could you not know?

     Misery pulls down the corners of Welles&#39; mouth.  He tries to
     find words, but none come.  He sits forward and hides his
     face in his hands, overwhelmed.  Cindy&#39;s crying.


     INT.  HOTEL ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Cindy sleeps, encircled by pillows and blankets on the bed.
     Amy watches her, runs her hand gently across Cindy&#39;s head.

     Amy rises, turns out the light, goes to a BALCONY DOOR...

     EXT.  HOTEL ROOM, BALCONY -- NIGHT

     Welles sits with his feet up on the balcony rail, looking
     into the parking lot.  Amy joins him, sits.

                             AMY
                 Promise you&#39;ll stay.

     Welles looks at Amy.

                             WELLES
                 Promise you won&#39;t go back there,
                 wherever you were.  Whatever it was,
                 forget it.

     Welles takes a deep breath, nods his head.

                             AMY
                 Promise me.

     Welles looks out into the night sky of stars.

                             WELLES
                 I promise.

     Amy comes to kiss Welles.  Welles wraps his arms around her
     and holds her tight.  She holds him.


     INT.  HOTEL ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Amy is asleep on the bed beside Cindy.  Welles comes out
     from the bathroom in a fresh shirt and suit, turns off the
     bathroom light.  He stands looking at Cindy and Amy.

     EXT.  HOTEL -- NIGHT

     Welles exits the hotel, heading to his Ford.


     INT.  WELLES&#39; CAR -- NIGHT

     Welles drives, staring ahead.  Through the windshield, the
     headlights illuminate the endless roadway.

     EXT.  KENNEDY AIRPORT -- NIGHT

     Airplanes take flight.  Manhattan glitters in the distance.


     EXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

     Eddie Poole&#39;s building.  A typically bright, sunny LA day.
     In the street, Welles parks a rental car, gets out.

     INT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- DAY

     ELEVATOR doors open and Welles gets off.  He moves down the
     hall, around a corner, heading to &quot;&lt;b&gt;Celebrity Films.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

     Welles tries the door knob, finds it locked.  He looks
     around, takes two steps back, KICKS forward... SMASHES the
     translucent glass of the door...

     INT.  CELEBRITY FILMS OFFICE -- DAY

     Welles pushes broken glass out of the way, reaches in to
     open the door.  The office has been cleaned out, trash on
     the floor, desk drawers hanging open and empty, shelves
     empty, posters gone...

     Welles grabs one of the file cabinets, pulls it open, finds
     it empty, pulls it all the way out and throws it.

     INT.  8TH FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

     People peer out from other offices, worried.  Welles exits
     Eddie&#39;s office, ignoring them, goes around the corner,
     straight to the STAIRWELL, heading downstairs...


     EXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS -- DAY

     Welles rental car parks down the hill.  Welles climbs out,
     walking up the hill, heading for Eddie&#39;s ramshackle HOUSE.

     EXT.  EDDIE&#39;S HOUSE, GARAGE -- DAY

     Under the stilts of the porch, Welles passes Eddie&#39;s car,
     looks in to see it loaded with BOXES and belongings.

     Welles moves on to a door at the back of the garage.  He
     takes out LOCK-PICKING TOOLS.

     INT.  EDDIE&#39;S HOUSE, STAIRWAY -- DAY

     Welles enters slow, pockets the tools, takes out his gun.
     FOLLOW him up the stairs, into a hallway, past a LAUNDRY
     ROOM with washer and dryer, into a LIVING ROOM...

     Welles sweeps the room with his gun, wired.  Eddie&#39;s house
     is predictably a trash heap, strewn with VIDEOS, MAGAZINES,
     dirty DISHES and fast food remnants.  Welles moves on...

     INT.  EDDIE&#39;S BEDROOM -- DAY

     Eddie&#39;s throwing clothing into a suitcase, hurried.  Welles
     comes into the doorway, taking aim, edging forward.

                             WELLES
                 Hello, Eddie.

     Eddie spins, startled.

                             WELLES
                 Put your hands on your head.

     Eddie looks out of the corner of his eye... to his GUN.

                             WELLES
                 Put your hands behind your head,
                 lock your finger together, get down
                 on your knees.

     Eddie does as commanded, gets to his knees.  Welles moves
     towards him, very nervous, white-knuckling the gun.
     He KICKS Eddie in the stomach, doubles him over.

                             WELLES
                 I owe you a few.

     Welles KICKS again.


     INT.  EDDIE&#39;S KITCHEN -- DAY

     Welles enters the filthy kitchen, carrying Eddie&#39;s gun.  At
     the sink, Welles pops the gun&#39;s clip.  He pushes the bullets
     out into his palm, one by one.

     He dumps the bullets into the GARBAGE DISPOSAL, drops the
     clip in, turns it on.  The DISPOSAL makes a terrible
     GRINDING NOISE, straining, till it finally goes dead.

     INT.  EDDIE&#39;S LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles goes to the picture window and closes the curtains.
     He turns on a lamp, goes back towards the bedroom.  After a
     moment, he returns, dragging Eddie on the floor...

     Eddie&#39;s bleeding out his nose, hands DUCT-TAPED together
     behind his back, legs bound at the ankle, dragged by a belt
     around his neck, choking...

     Welles drops the belt, undoes it from Eddie&#39;s neck.  Eddie
     gasps for air.  Welles pulls him up, puts him on the couch.

                             WELLES
                 Don&#39;t go anywhere.

     Welles heads for the stairs...

     EXT.  EDDIE&#39;S GARAGE -- DAY

     Welles goes to Eddie car, tries the door, it&#39;s unlocked...

     IN THE CAR

     Welles takes the thick THOMAS GUIDE map book off the dash.

     INT.  EDDIE&#39;S LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles returns.  Eddie&#39;s on the floor, wriggling.  Welles
     drops the Thomas Guide on the coffee table, picks Eddie up,
     throws him back onto the couch.

                             EDDIE
                 I&#39;m gonna kill you.

                             WELLES
                 Don&#39;t bore me with that bullshit.

                             EDDIE
                 How&#39;d you find me here?

     Welles PUNCHES Eddie in the ear.

                             WELLES
                 Don&#39;t ask questions.

                             EDDIE
                 Fuck you! 

     Welles PUNCHES Eddie in the same ear.  Eddie&#39;s hurting.
     Welles rubs his aching knuckles.

                             WELLES
                 Starting to recognize a pattern?

                             EDDIE
                 What do you want?

                             WELLES
                 Who is Machine?

                             EDDIE
                 I don&#39;t know...

                             WELLES
                 I want his name.

                             EDDIE
                 I told you, I don&#39;t know.

                             WELLES 
                 I will never get tired of hurting
                 you, Eddie, so you might want to
                 change your attitude.

                             EDDIE
                 What the fuck am I gonna protect
                 that freak for?  He was Dino&#39;s boy,
                 not mine.  He shows up with his mask
                 on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody
                 knows.

     Welles kicks junk off a chair, sits, takes out his gun.

                             WELLES
                 Okay, we&#39;ll come back to that.  So,
                 six years ago a guy contacts you,
                 through the classifieds, over the
                 phone, however he does it.  It&#39;s
                 Longdale, looking for a snuff film.
                 And you, entrepreneur that you are,
                 tell him you can hook him up.

                             EDDIE
                 Yeah, the fucking lawyer.

                             WELLES
                 Told him you could get him a snuff
                 film.

                             EDDIE
                 Yeah.

                             WELLES
                 How much did he pay you?

                             EDDIE
                 Thirty thousand each, that fucking
                 cocksucker.

                             WELLES
                 That&#39;s all?  Thirty each.  That&#39;s
                 all it took for you to murder her?

                             EDDIE
                 It was a lot of fucking money.

     Welles stands and paces, despairing.  He picks up a LAMP and
     throws it, SHATTERS a MIRROR, keeps pacing...

                             WELLES
                 So... you brought Dino in, and he
                 brought Machine.  And, one day, a
                 girl walked into your office because
                 you had an ad in the paper for
                 models.  And she never walked out.

                             EDDIE
                 Something like that.

                             WELLES
                 What did you do, knock her out,
                 shoot her up... ?

                             EDDIE
                 What the fuck do you want from me?

                             WELLES
                 I want to know.  I want to know
                 exactly what you did to her!

                             EDDIE
                 Fuck you then, you want to know?  I
                 talked her up, told her how
                 beautiful she was, told her she was
                 gonna be a star.  I told her I was
                 gonna get her a screen test, and
                 while I&#39;m doing that, I got her a
                 soda and dropped a mickey.  When it
                 was dark enough, I rang Dino and
                 told him it was go time, I put her
                 in the trunk of my car and we went
                 and we fucking did it.  That&#39;s what
                 happened.  She&#39;s dead.  She&#39;s been
                 dead a long fucking time.  Nobody
                 fucking cares!

     Welles puts down his gun, picks up the Thomas Guide, holding
     it in both hands, SWINGS -- SLAMS Eddie across the face...

     Eddie&#39;s stunned, lips bleeding.  He faces forward.

                             EDDIE
                 You wanted to know, now you know.

     Welles SWINGS the Thomas Guide -- POUNDS Eddie&#39;s face again.

     Welles drops the Thomas Guide in a chair, picks up his gun,
     leaves the room...

     INT.  EDDIE&#39;S KITCHEN -- DAY

     Welles enters, starts looking through DRAWERS, searching.
     He finds SILVERWARE, selects a serrated STEAK KNIFE...

     INT.  EDDIE&#39;S LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles returns, goes to grasp Eddie by the shirt collar,
     drags him to the floor, face down.  Welles stands on Eddie&#39;s
     neck, uses the knife to cut the duct tape on Eddie&#39;s hands.

                             EDDIE
                 That&#39;s right, motherfucker, cut me
                 loose.  Be a man.

     Welles tosses the knife, gun trained on Eddie, picks up the
     Thomas Guide and throws it at Eddie... 

                             WELLES
                 Show me!

     Eddie, hands now free, pushes himself to a seated position,
     looks at the Thomas Guide.

                             WELLES
                 Show me where you did it, on the
                 map, exactly where you did it.

                             EDDIE
                 Why?

                             WELLES
                 Because we&#39;re going there.


     EXT.  134 FREEWAY -- DAY

     Welles&#39; rental car SPEEDS down the highway, east towards
     Pasadena, leaving the City of Los Angeles on the horizon.

     EXT.  MOUNTAIN HIGHWAY -- DAY

     Welles&#39; car travels a winding HIGHWAY that serpentines up
     into the scenic, forested SAN BERNADINO MOUNTAINS.

     EXT.  BIG BEAR -- DUSK

     The sun is low.  Big Bear Lake is vast, surrounded by
     wilderness on all sides.  Welles&#39; car follows a TWO-LANE
     ROADWAY that runs along the lake&#39;s southern shore.

     Welles&#39; car passes sporadic SUMMER HOMES and CABINS.

     EXT.  DESERTED ROADWAY -- NIGHT

     Heavy forests border close to the road.  Welles&#39; car travels
     alone, headlights on, slowing as it comes to an overgrown
     gravel DRIVEWAY with a rusty CHAIN strung across it.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles leans forward to look up at an old SIGN of broken
     neon and peeled paint: &quot;&lt;b&gt;Big Bear Motor Lodge.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

     Welles pulls forward, puts the car in reverse...

     ON THE ROADWAY

     Welles&#39; car backs up, angling, till the rear bumper comes
     against the chain, BACKING... till the CHAIN SNAPS.

     Welles&#39; car pulls forward across the empty roadway, turns
     around... accelerates down the overgrown driveway...

     EXT.  BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT

     Welles&#39; car comes down the driveway, into a small LOT.

     IN THE CAR

     THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: headlights reveal what&#39;s left of the
     abandoned MOTOR LODGE, a REGISTRATION OFFICE at the center
     with attached wings of rooms on both sides.

     The LEFT WING of rooms is a fire ravaged, burnt-out
     skeleton.  What remains of the OFFICE and RIGHT WING is
     boarded over, falling apart.  No window has gone unbroken.

     IN THE LOT

     Welles turns out headlights and parks.
     He gets out, walks to look up the driveway.  A CAR is HEARD.
     HEADLIGHTS can be seen a good distance away through the
     forest as the CAR PASSES.

     Welles goes to his car, unlocks the trunk and opens it.
     Eddie&#39;s lying in there, arms and legs bound, gagged.

     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT

     The door is shoved inward, hanging crooked by one hinge.
     Eddie enters first, hands still bound behind him.  Welles
     pushes Eddie forward, gun out.

     Welles turns on his penlight FLASHLIGHT, shining it into the
     room.  There dead leaves all over the floor.  The room&#39;s
     empty except for a CHAIR lying on its side.

     Welles sweeps the room with the inadequate light.  This is
     where Mary Anne Mathews died, vaguely recognizable from the
     snuff film, without the furniture.

                             EDDIE
                 What are we doing here?

     Welles goes to the bathroom door, keeping the gun trained on
     Eddie, pushes the bathroom door open with his foot...

     The bathroom&#39;s cracked MIRROR reflects the penlight and
     Welles&#39; palely lit face.

                             WELLES 
                 That night... you didn&#39;t have to be
                 in the room, but you were.
                       (looks to Eddie)
                 Why?  Why did you watch?

     Eddie goes to the chair, tips it upright with his foot, sits.

                             EDDIE
                 I don&#39;t know.  I felt like it.  I
                 never saw anyone get done before.

                             WELLES
                 You enjoy it? 

                             EDDIE
                 Made me sick, but what did I care?
                 What did I care if some hump wants
                 to beat off to that.  It was just
                 something I was doing for money.

                             WELLES
                 Tell me what happened.

                             EDDIE
                 What do you want to know?  You saw
                 it, you saw the loop...

                             WELLES
                 Nobody saw you bring her in?

                             EDDIE
                 There wasn&#39;t nobody around.  This
                 place was a shit-hole.  I backed up
                 the car to the door and we carried
                 her in, like groceries.  Dino made
                 her eat a bunch of pills, we laid
                 out the plastic, put film in the
                 camera and Machine went to work.

                             WELLES
                 What did you do with her body?

                             EDDIE
                 Took it out the bathroom window.
                 Buried it in the woods.

                             WELLES
                 Show me.

     EXT.  BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT

     Eddie and Welles come around the corner of the abandoned
     motel, Eddie leading the way, Welles following with gun and
     flashlight, into the dense forest...

                             EDDIE
                 What are you thinking you&#39;re gonna
                 do... ?

     Welles shoves Eddie ahead.

                             WELLES
                 Keep moving.

                             EDDIE
                 Where do you think you&#39;re taking
                 this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero,
                 avenge that little girl&#39;s death?
                 Gonna make everything right with the
                 world?  How you gonna do that... ? 

     FURTHER ON

     Welles and Eddie come over a hill, deeper into the forest...

                             EDDIE
                 You can&#39;t go to the cops.  All you
                 can do is cut me loose and walk
                 away, because you got nothing...

                             WELLES
                 Stop talking.

                             EDDIE
                 You got absolute zero.

                             WELLES
                 Show me where you buried her.

                             EDDIE
                 I don&#39;t know...
                       (nods to forest)
                 ... out there somewhere.

                             WELLES
                 Where?  Show me where.

                             EDDIE
                 I fucking don&#39;t know.  What do you
                 think... we weren&#39;t burying
                 treasure.  We didn&#39;t pace it out so
                 we could come back and get it.  We
                 dug a hole and we put her in it.
                 Your guess is as good as mine.

     Welles walks ahead of Eddie, distraught, shining his
     flashlight ahead across the indecipherable forest floor.

                             EDDIE
                 You&#39;ll never find her.  Nobody ever
                 will, and even if they did, it
                 doesn&#39;t mean nothing.  Bring in the
                 cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck &#39;em
                 all.  Without the film, it never
                 happened.  Don&#39;t you get it?  It&#39;s
                 over.  You can&#39;t do anything.

     Welles turns, aims his gun at Eddie, furious.

                             WELLES
                 I can kill you.  I can leave you out
                 here, just like you left her.

     Eddie&#39;s not backing down.

                             EDDIE
                 Do it.

                             WELLES
                 Don&#39;t think I won&#39;t.

                             EDDIE
                 Do it!  Put me out of my misery so
                 I don&#39;t have to listen to you
                 whining anymore.  You think it&#39;s so
                 easy?

                             WELLES
                 Easy enough for you.

                             EDDIE
                 I never killed anyone.

                             WELLES
                 That&#39;s right, you just stood there
                 and watched, because you &quot;felt like
                 it.&quot;  Almost makes you worse.

                             EDDIE
                 What do you want?  You want me to
                 fall to my knees and start crying
                 like a baby... ?

     Eddie walks towards Welles.  Welles backs away...

                             EDDIE
                 Where you going?  You&#39;re the one
                 with the gun.  Aren&#39;t I defenseless
                 enough?  Come on...

     Eddie comes ahead, defiant, the gun inches from his face.

                             EDDIE
                 Go ahead and kill me.  Kill me with
                 that gun, your gun, right,
                 registered in your name?  Dig the
                 hole yourself, with your bare hands,
                 bury the body with your bullets in
                 it.  Fucking do it!

     Welles step forward, presses the gun against Eddie&#39;s
     forehead, pulls back the hammer... 

     Eddie just stares back at Welles with hatred in his eyes.

     Welles is terrified, unsure... trying to muster the courage
     to do it... gun hand trembling... finger on the trigger...


     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT

     Eddie&#39;s thrown face down to the floor.  Welles comes to sit
     on Eddie&#39;s back, facing Eddie&#39;s feet, holsters his gun,
     takes out duct tape and grabs Eddie&#39;s feet, wrapping them...

                             EDDIE
                 You pussy.

     Welles keeps going around Eddie&#39;s ankles with the duct tape,
     till Eddie&#39;s securely bound.

     He rips the tape roll free and gets up, walking out...

                             EDDIE
                 Fucking pussy!

     EXT.  MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT

     Welles pulls the door closed behind him, walks to his car.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles opens the passenger door and sits, shaken, at his
     wit&#39;s end.  He opens the glove compartment, finds
     cigarettes, digs one out and lights it.

     He looks back to the motel room.

     He looks down to the glove compartment, at his CELLULAR
     PHONE.  After a moment, Welles picks up the phone, looks at
     it in his hand.

     IN THE LOT

     Welles gets out of the car, gets up on the hood, lays back,
     staring at the sky.  He closes his eyes, smokes.

     Welles opens the phone, looks at the illuminated numbers.
     He digs in his suit jacket pocket, takes out his notepad,
     pages through, studies one page.

     Welles sits up.  He gathers himself, throws his cigarette,
     dials a number, puts the cellular to his ear, afraid...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 Hello... ?

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Mrs. Mathews?  It&#39;s Thomas.  Do you
                 remember, I was there a few weeks
                 ago... asking about your daughter...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                       (from phone)
                 I remember.  You just left...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 I have to tell you something.  It
                 won&#39;t be easy for you to hear.  It&#39;s
                 about your daughter... Mary Anne...
                       (struggling)
                 When I... when I was there with you,
                 her diary, in your attic, in
                 silverware.  If you read it, you&#39;ll
                 know what I&#39;m telling you is true... 

     Welles climbs off the car, paces, aching with misery...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 What are you talking about... ?

                             WELLES
                 She went to California, to Los
                 Angeles... she wanted to start over.
                 She wanted to be an actress...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 What... ?

     Tears comes to Welles&#39; eyes.  It&#39;s the hardest thing he&#39;s
     ever had to do in his entire life.

                             WELLES
                 Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead.
                 She&#39;s dead.

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 Who is this... ?

                             WELLES
                 Someone... some men, they took your
                 daughter and they drugged her, and
                 they took her to a motel room...
                 they did terrible things to her...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 Who are you?

                             WELLES
                 They brought her into the room...
                 one man, he put a knife to her
                 throat and he raped her...

                             MRS MATHEWS
                 No...

                             WELLES
                 He raped her and...and...and he
                 murdered her...he cut her up with
                 knifes...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 No... no... no...

                             WELLES
                 They killed her, and they took her
                 out in the forest somewhere and they
                 buried her...

                             MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)
                 Why... why are you doing this to
                 me... ?

                             WELLES
                 They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I&#39;m
                 sorry.  It happened a month after
                 she ran away.  She&#39;s been dead all
                 this time...

     MRS MATHEWS is HEARD SCREAMING, letting out a CHOCKING SOB.
     Welles falls back against the car, holds his head, weeping...

                             WELLES
                 I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m so sorry... there
                 wasn&#39;t anything anyone could do...

     Welles pushes disconnect, lowers the phone, drops it to the
     ground, utterly drained.  He puts his forearm over his eyes,
     gasping, sucking air...

     He looks to the motel room, tamping down his sorrow, willing
     it to fuel his rage...

     He takes out his gun, hands unsteady, determined, opens the
     gun and pours the bullets out.  He closes the gun and walks
     towards the motel room...

     INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles SHOVES the door aside.  The door&#39;s hinge breaks and
     the door falls...

     Eddie sits propped up against one wall, turns to look...

     The door SLAMS to the floor.

     Welles moves forward, enraged, closing on Eddie, raising his
     arm with the gun grasped by the butt...

     Eddie&#39;s eyes go wide with fear...

     Welles SWINGS the gun down at Eddie&#39;s head...

     EXT.  MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

     The only SOUNDS come from the NIGHT FOREST.  CRICKETS and
     distant BIRDS.  We can&#39;t see anything but the TOTAL DARKNESS
     through the open door of the room.  A CAR is HEARD, getting
     LOUDER as it passes, FAINTER as it gets further away.

     Finally, Welles comes to the doorway, in shock, steadying
     himself against the door frame, shirt and suit spattered
     red.  His gun hand and gun are soaked with dripping blood.

     Welles looks back into the room, backing away.  He turns and
     goes to his car...

     IN THE CAR

     Welles climbs in the driver&#39;s side, shoves his bloody gun
     into his holster, tries to wipe blood from his hand onto his
     shirt, revolted.  He starts the car. 

     INT.  EDDIE&#39;S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles enters and crosses through...

     INT.  EDDIE&#39;S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Welles goes to the kitchen sink, turns on the water, starts
     scrubbing his bloody hands, using dishwashing liquid,
     scrubbing his hands desperately under running water.

     EXT.  EDDIE&#39;S GARAGE -- NIGHT

     Welles comes out of the house, goes to open the rear door of
     Eddie&#39;s car, looking through BOXES of Eddie&#39;s belongings...

     INT.  EDDIE&#39;S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles comes up the stairs with a BOX, dumps the contents
     onto the living room floor: it&#39;s CHILD PORNOGRAPHY, Eddie&#39;s
     collection from the office, HUNDREDS of PHOTOS...

     INT.  EDDIE&#39;S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Welles pulls open Eddie&#39;s cabinets, searching.  He finds
     POTS and PANS, choosing a few of the largest...

     EXT.  EDDIE&#39;S GARAGE -- NIGHT

     Welles uses a cut piece of GARDEN HOSE, siphoning GAS out
     from Eddie&#39;s car, filling several kitchen POTS...

     INT.  EDDIE&#39;S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles comes up the stairs, carries POTS of gasoline, dumps
     the gasoline onto the pile of PHOTOGRAPHS...

     INT.  EDDIE&#39;S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles dumps gasoline over Eddie&#39;s bed...

     INT.  LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles stands at the pile of gasoline soaked photos, taking
     out a MATCHBOOK, lighting one, lighting the whole book...

     EXT.  EDDIE&#39;S HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Welles walks down the dark hill, heading to his car.  He
     gets in, starts the car and drives downhill, leaving the
     headlights off.  BEHIND, the windows of Eddie&#39;s ramshackle
     HOUSE grow bright as FIRE SPREADS and CURTAINS BURN.


     INT.  LOS ANGELES AIRPORT -- NIGHT

     Welles stares ahead, in fresh shirt and suit, waiting at a
     CHECK-IN COUNTER. 

     The female AIRLINE AGENT behind the counter types in her
     COMPUTER, stamps his ticket.

     Welles shifts his gaze, something catches his eye...

     Beside a stapler on the counter, a PAIR of SCISSORS.

                             AGENT
                 There you are, Mr. Welles, confirmed
                 through to Kennedy.  Gate 32B.

     Welles stares, fixated on the SCISSORS.

                             AGENT
                 Mr. Welles?

     Welles looks to the agent holding up the ticket.

                             AGENT
                 Gate 32B.

     Welles accepts the ticket.


     EXT.  MANHATTAN MOTEL -- NIGHT

     The Empire State Building in the distance says NYC, and a
     CAMERA PAN DOWN says another seedy MOTEL...

     INT.  MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles sits at a small desk, looking through a PHONE BOOK,
     white pages, finds... &quot;&lt;b&gt;HOSPITALS.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

     Welles picks up the PHONE, chooses a number, dials it...

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Hello, can you connect me with the
                 duty nurse?
                      (waits)
                 Hello, this is Lieutenant Anderson
                 down here in the Thirteenth
                 Precinct.  I&#39;ve got a helluva
                 problem I was hoping you could give
                 me a hand with.  We had a stabbing
                 incident a couple of days ago, and
                 it looks like the supposed victim
                 gave us a false name and address.
                 Can you tell me if you had an adult
                 male with an abdominal wound in you
                 ER in the last forty-eight hours?
                       (listens)
                 You&#39;d remember this guy; a body-
                 builder, real big guy, five foot
                 eleven, with acne all over his chest
                 and back...
                       (listens)
                 Alright, thanks for your help. 

     Welles hangs up, uses a pen to cross out a number in the
     phone book, starts dialing the next number.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:

     INT.  MOTEL ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Welles lies on the bed, on the phone, rubbing his eyes.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 ... guy sticks out like a sore
                 thumb.  Five foot ten or eleven,
                 body-builder, bad acne...
                       (listen)
                 Okay, thanks anyway.

     Welles gets up, hangs up, brings the phone back to the desk.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:

     INT.  MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING

     The PHONE BOOK&#39;S open on the desk with nearly a hundred
     hospital phone numbers crossed out.

                             WELLES (O.S.)
                 ... abdominal wound.  You&#39;d know him
                 if you saw him... 

     Light cuts into the room from between the curtains.  Welles
     paces, carrying the phone with him, weary.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 He&#39;s a body-builder, stands just
                 under six feet...

     Welles stops in his track, listening, suddenly attentive.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 That&#39;s right... covered in acne.
                 That&#39;s him, that&#39;s the guy.  Listen,
                 we, uh... we think he filed a bogus
                 report on this stabbing, gave us a
                 false name and address...
                       (listens)
                 Yes, I&#39;ll hold.

     Welles goes to the desk, takes out his notepad.  He starts
     feeling his pockets for his pen, can&#39;t find it, telephone
     book, searching, looks under the desk...

     Welles ducks under the desk to grab the pen off the floor.

                             WELLES
                       (into phone)
                 Yes... yes.
                       (sits, writing in pad)
                 Christopher Higgins.  Thirty-
                 fifteen, Thirty Fifth Street.
                 Where?  Astoria, Queens.

     Welles is scribbling all this down in his notepad.


     EXT.  QUEENS STREET -- DAY

     A relatively quiet residential street.  HOMES are small, two
     story affairs, close together, each very much like its
     neighbor, some with tiny yards fenced in by brick walls.

     Welles&#39; Ford comes slowly down the street.  CHILDREN in
     school uniforms are heading off for the day in groups.

     Welles parallel parks.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles turns off the engine.
     He&#39;s watching a HOUSE on the other side of the street.  The
     house is brick on the bottom, aluminum siding on top,
     quaint, with brick staircase from the front door down to a
     GARAGE underneath, plastic PINK FLAMINGOS on the small lawn.

     Cars pass in the street.  Welles watches school children
     pass on the near sidewalk.  He slumps down a little in his
     seat, adjusting the rearview mirror, adjusting his side
     mirror, rolling up the window.

     Welles takes a cautionary look around, takes out his gun,
     pours bullets out and pockets them.  He picks up a PAPER BAG
     off the passenger seat and opens it.

     He takes out a long, thin metal FILE, pulling off the shrink
     wrap packaging, feels the file with his thumb.

     Keeping his open gun low under the steering wheel, Welles
     slides the file into the barrel, scraping gently all along
     the gun&#39;s inner barrel.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:

     INT.  WELLES&#39; CAR -- LATER DAY

     Welles sits smoking a cigarette, watching the quaint house.
     He looks in his side mirror...

     There&#39;s a large CAR coming down the block with its turn
     signal on.  Welles slumps a little lower.

     The car passes, slowing.  The GARAGE DOOR of the quaint
     house begins to open. 

     Welles watches...
     Can&#39;t really see the driver of the car except for the back
     of his head, but he&#39;s huge.  It&#39;s a good bet it&#39;s Machine.
     Beside him in the passenger seat is a GREY HAIRED OLD WOMAN.

     The car pulls into the darkness of the quaint house&#39;s
     garage.  After a moment, the OLD WOMAN comes from the
     garage, walks with a cane, wears glasses.  She goes to the
     sidewalk, checks her MAILBOX, finds it empty.

     Welles watches.

     The old woman goes back to the garage.  She goes inside.
     The garage door closes behind her.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:

     INT.  WELLES&#39; CAR -- NIGHT

     Welles still watches the house.  There&#39;s a light on in one
     of the second floor windows, curtains closed.

     Welles yawns, shaking his head, trying to stay awake.

     At the quaint house, a light comes on in the front picture
     window.  Looks like a living room or dining room.  The old
     woman comes to sit at a table.

     Welles takes binoculars off the front seat...

     THROUGH BINOCULARS

     The old woman says something to someone we cannot see.
     She&#39;s at the dinner table, with a place setting in front of
     her.  After a moment, someone joins her...

     It&#39;s Machine, you can tell by his bulk, by his huge
     forearms.  The lacy curtains of the window block part of our
     view, so we never see his face.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles lowers the binoculars, still watching.

     Through the window across the street, Machine can be seen
     putting a plate of food in front of the old woman.  The old
     woman smiles up at him, says something.

     Machine goes to light two candles on the table with matches,
     then goes back to stand beside the old woman.

     Machine is seen from behind, bends to give the old woman a
     kiss on the cheek, then leaves the room.  The old woman
     starts to eat.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; CAR -- DAY

     Dawn light is just breaking.  Welles has fallen asleep,
     slumped low behind the wheel, snoring lightly.

     Welles awakens with a start, looking around, confused.  He
     calms, rubbing his eyes, wiping sweat from his features.

     ACROSS THE STREET

     The quaint house&#39;s garage door begins to rise.

     IN THE CAR

     Welles sees this, keeps low, watching...
     The big car backs out into the street.  The old woman&#39;s
     behind the wheel, wearing a hat, driving away, alone.

     Welles watches the car head away in the rear view mirror.

     ON THE STREET

     Welles gets out of his car, shuts the door quietly behind
     him.  He starts walking towards the quaint house, looks all
     directions, making sure no one&#39;s around.

     Ahead, the garage door begins to close.

     Welles picks up the pace, trying not to look too
     conspicuous.  The garage door&#39;s halfway down...

     Welles runs towards the garage, has to dive and roll to get
     there, but he makes it under the door just as it closes.

     ABOVE

     In ONE WINDOW of the quaint house, an eyeball is peering out
     from lacy curtains, then moves away and curtains fall shut.

     INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, GARAGE -- DAY

     Welles gets up, takes out his gun, brushing off.
     The garage is dark, full of BOXES and JUNK.  Welles moves
     towards the door to the house.

     INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY

     Machine, in T-shirt and jeans, &lt;u&gt;seen only from behind&lt;/u&gt;, comes
     to a DRESSER and opens a bottom drawer.  His huge hands push
     clothing aside, digging deep to the bottom of the drawer,
     taking out the WRESTLING MASK.

     Machine stands straight, pulling the mask down over his head.

     INT.  BASEMENT -- DAY

     Welles enters from the garage, gun up.  The dank basement is
     small.  A PILE of LAUNDRY lies on the floor near a WASHING
     MACHINE. 

     SHEETS hang off several CLOTHES LINES strung across two
     metal poles.  Welles leads with his gun...

     He moves around the sheets, looking behind them.  There&#39;s a
     WOODEN STAIRCASE leading upstairs.  Welles starts up,
     treading lightly, trying not to make a sound...

     INT.  KITCHEN -- DAY

     Welles slowly opens the door to the kitchen, pointing his
     gun.  No one here.  The decor is feminine, neat and tidy.
     It&#39;s grandma&#39;s house, and it shows, with gaudy PRINT
     WALLPAPER everywhere, every shelf displaying HUMMEL
     FIGURINES or COLLECTORS PLATES.  Very Home Shopping Network.

     INT.  DINING ROOM/LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     Welles slowly opens the swinging door, entering from the
     kitchen, sweeping the room with his gun.  No sign of
     Machine.  The whole house is dead quiet.

     He passes the dining room TABLE where he watched the old
     woman eat last night... passes fake PAINTINGS on the walls,
     of waterfalls and sunset mountain landscapes... moves into
     the living room area...

     Yellow shag CARPET.  A pink SOFA is covered in clear
     plastic, facing an old TELEVISION in faux-wooden cabinet.
     Welles heads for a staircase leading to the second floor.

     Welles creeps up the stairs...

     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

     Welles comes up from the stairs, arrives at a closed DOOR.
     He opens the door.  It&#39;s a linen closet, with TOWELS and
     SHEETS on shelves, and a shelf of MEDICINE.

     Welles shuts the door and moves on.  There are TWO DOORS
     ahead, both closed.  Welles takes the one to the right...

     INT.  MACHINE&#39;S BEDROOM -- DAY

     Welles pushes the door in, enters warily.  There&#39;s a
     constant SCRATCHING HEARD.  The room is like a child&#39;s,
     except the BED is huge.  Shelves are full of BOARDGAMES and
     COMIC BOOKS.  A DANZIG POSTER on the wall.  There&#39;s a RECORD
     PLAYER with LP RECORDS beside it.  A record turns on the
     turntable, the needle caught at the center, SCRATCHING...

     Welles eases his way over to the closet... reaching...
     Pulls it open, steps back, gun up.  Nothing.  Just clothing.

     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

     Welles crosses, opens the door across the hall, enters...

     DOWN THE HALL, very slowly, Machine&#39;s head rises on the
     stairs, in the garish wrestling mask, peering.

     INT.  GRANDMA&#39;S ROOM -- DAY

     Welles stays near the door, looks around.  There&#39;s a fuzzy
     sky-blue COMFORTER on the bed, fuzzy blue SLIPPERS nearby.
     Lots of bottles of MEDICINE on the bedside table.

     Welles lowers his gun, takes a step back, into the hall...

     INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY

     Welles turns...
     Machine charges down the hall, screaming with rage, BOWIE
     KNIFE raised to kill...

     Welles brings his gun up, but Machine&#39;s upon him, stabbing...

     Welles catches Machine&#39;s hand, stops the knife.  Machine
     grips Welles&#39; gun hand, shoving him back...

     Welles is SLAMMED against the wall, grappling, gun hand
     pinned.  Welles GUN GOES OFF, once... twice...

     BLOWING HOLES in the ceiling.  Machine&#39;s grunts, pushing the
     knife forward... closer to Welles, face... closer...

     Welles struggles, overpowered.  The tip of the horrible
     knife is inches away...

     Welles bends his knees, crouching, trying to gain distance
     from the blade...

     Machine pulls Welles gun hand lower, brings it against the
     swinging LAUNDRY CHUTE DOOR built into the wall, begins
     twisting Welles&#39; hand back, trying to pry the gun loose...

     Welles looks out the corner of his eyes to his gun...

     Welles turns his gun hand, slowing struggling to aim the gun
     towards the knife, but it&#39;s awful close to his face...

     The knife&#39;s shaking, less than an inch from Welles&#39; cheek...

     Welles shuts his eyes and turns his head, letting out a CRY,
     FIRES his gun...

     The bullet BLASTS Machine&#39;s knife, knocks it away!

     Machine recoils for a millisecond, but brings his now free
     hand to Welles&#39; throat, choking him.  Welles&#39; face reddens,
     bleeding from bullet fragments...

     Welles tries to pry Machine&#39;s fingers from his throat.

     Machine works on Welles&#39; gun hand with violent, renewed
     effort -- SLAMS Welles&#39; hand against the laundry chute...
     SLAMS it... SLAMS it... till Welles DROPS the GUN...
     The gun can be HEARD CLATTERING down the chute. 

     Machine brings his hand to join the other around Welles&#39;
     throat.  Welles can&#39;t break the grip...

     Welles PUNCHES Machine&#39;s face, till blood runs out from the
     mask&#39;s nose hole, but it&#39;s having no effect...

     Welles brings his KNEE UP HARD -- into Machine&#39;s stomach!

     Machine falls to his knees with a ROAR, holds his already
     wounded stomach, bleeding through his shirt...

     Welles falls, clutching his throat, gasping.  He struggles
     to his feet, leaps past, headlong towards the stairs...

     Machine rises, charging after...

     ON THE STAIRCASE

     Welles is TACKLED from behind...
     Welles and Machine TUMBLE down the stairs, SMASHING the
     wooden railing, toppling a BOOKSHELF... LANDING HARD...

     Welles PUNCHES and KICKS, breaking free, running across the
     living room.  Machine rises to give chase...

     Welles grabs a dining room CHAIR and THROWS it...
     Machine knocks the chair aside, keeps coming.  Welles grips
     another chair, uses it to hold Machine off...

     Machine grips the chair by the legs.  Welles SHOVES forward,
     pushes Machine back, letting go...

     Welles dives under the dining table, crawling on his hands
     and knees, scrambling...

     Machine throws the chair, runs, leaps...
     Machine lands on the table, crawls to the far edge, GRABBING
     down with his meaty fists as Welles moves forward...

     Under the table, Welles jerks back, avoiding, then rises,
     extending his knees, PUSHING upwards from underneath...

     Welles FLIPS the table, throwing Machine to the floor...

     Welles charges towards the kitchen door, falls, gets up...
     Machine gets to his feet...

     IN THE KITCHEN

     Welles SHOVES through the swinging door...
     Machine BURSTS through, catching Welles, TACKLING him...

     Welles hits the floor with Machine on top.  Machine begins
     to rein PUNCHES down on Welles, head and back...

     Welles tries to cover up, taking a real beating...

     Machine rises, gripping Welles, LIFTING him, THROWS him...

     Welles SMASHES into shelves of knick-knacks over the kitchen
     sink, SHATTERING a WINDOW, landing on the sink and counter.

     Machine comes to grip Welles again, drags him across the
     counter, KNOCKING EVERYTHING to the floor...
     Machine SWINGS Welles, releases him...

     Welles SLAMS the refrigerator and slumps to the ground,
     tries to stay conscious, trying weakly to get back up...
     Machine comes to Welles, gets on his knees...

     Machine wraps his arm around Welles&#39; neck from behind, gets
     him in a CHOKE HOLD, tightens his grip, cutting off Welles
     airway with his forearm...

     Welles tries to break Machine&#39;s impossible grip with one
     hand, begins searching the floor with his other hand...
     frantically feeling for anything he can use...

     Welles&#39; face is blood red...

     Welles&#39; hand grasps desperately... finds a FORK, grips it...

     Welles SWINGS the fork back, STABS it into Machine&#39;s thigh!

     Machine SCREAMS, releases Welles and falls back, reaching
     around to the fork...

     Welles gets to his knees, sucking air, turns to look...

     Machine crawls away, pulls the fork out with trembling
     fingers.  Beyond him, there&#39;s the BASEMENT DOOR.

     Welles gets to his feet, looking...
     He grabs a FRYING PAN off the counter, gripping it in both
     hands and moving towards Machine...

     Machine&#39;s getting up...
     Welles BASHES Machine in the face with an upward swing of
     the frying pan...

     Machine is sent backpedaling, CRASHING into the oven!

     Welles drops the pan, leaps over Machine, to the door...

     IN THE BASEMENT

     Welles comes down the stairs, falls when he gets to the
     bottom, barely has any strength left.  He looks all
     directions, sees the LAUNDRY CHUTE in the ceiling...

     Welles gets up, stumbling, falls to his knees at the PILE of
     dirty LAUNDRY, starts digging through it, searching
     desperately, throwing clothing aside...

     Behind, Machine comes down the stairs, a bloody mess...

     Welles searches the laundry pile... 

     Machine reaches the bottom of the stairs, heading for
     Welles.  Welles turns, has the GUN in hand, FIRES TWICE...
     HITTING Machine in the shoulder and stomach, knocking
     Machine a few steps backwards...

     Welles FIRES...

     Machine&#39;s HIT in the CHEST, falling back, into hanging
     laundry, pulling down the clothes line and sheets...

     Machine hits the ground, wrapped in sheets.

     Welles stands, still aiming the gun, pulls the trigger on an
     empty chamber.  Out of bullets.

     Machine&#39;s trying to pull free from the sheets, trying to get
     back up to his feet.  Welles lets out a sob, drops the gun,
     walking to Machine...

     Welles climbs onto Machine from behind, takes clothing line
     in hand, starts wrapping the cord around Machine&#39;s throat...

     Welles pulls back on the clothes line, pulling it tight...

     Machine tries to get his fingers around the cord.  Welles
     stands, pulling tighter, putting a foot on Machine&#39;s back,
     pulling the clothes line with all his might...

     The cord&#39;s cutting into Welles&#39; hand, drawing blood.

     Machine, face down, lets out a gurgling sound, struggling,
     struggling... till he finally stops moving.

     Welles releases the cord, takes a step back, breathing hard,
     trembling.  He looks around the basement.

     Welles walks to pick up his gun, replaces the gun in his
     holster.  He stands looking at Machine.

     Welles walks to Machine, bends, grasps Machine wrestling
     mask, pulling it off.  He rolls Machine over...

     Welles stares down at Machine.  &lt;u&gt;We never see Machine&#39;s face&lt;/u&gt;.

     INT.  KITCHEN -- DAY

     Welles comes up from the basement, slow, hurting.  He looks
     around at the damage done, looks down to see he&#39;s still
     holding Machine&#39;s mask.  He drops it.

     EXT.  QUAINT HOUSE -- DAY

     Welles crosses the street, going to his car.  He gets into
     his car, starts it, pulls out and drives away.


     EXT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE -- DAY

     BIRDS SING.  KIDS are kicking around a soccer ball down the
     street.  Welles&#39; Ford arrives, pulls into the driveway.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY -- DAY

     Welles comes in the front door, still a horrible mess.

                             WELLES
                 Hello?!  Amy?

     He waits.  The house is quiet.  No one home.


     EXT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE -- LATER DAY

     Dusk.  A CAR comes down the street, slows...

     IN THE CAR

     Amy sits forward, seeing Welles&#39; car in the driveway.
     Cindy&#39;s in a child safety seat in back.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY -- DAY

     Amy comes in the front door, carrying Amy.

                             AMY
                 Tom?!

     No answer.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY

     Any pushes the bedroom door open and looks in.  Welles is
     asleep on the bed, still in his clothing and shoes.  Amy
     watches him sleep, sad.

     Amy backs out of the room, pulls the door shut.


     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Dark.  Welles sleeps, still in bloody clothing.  He&#39;s
     restless, shifting, MUTTERING under his breath.  Bad dreams.

     Welles suddenly sits bolt upright in the bed, looking around
     the dark room, breathing hard.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Cindy&#39;s in her high-chair by the table.  Amy&#39;s at the
     KITCHEN SINK, washing vegetables, peeling potatoes.

     Welles comes to stand in the doorway behind her.  Amy turns
     to look at him.  It breaks her heart to see him so wounded,
     but she forces herself to continue working in the sink.

                             AMY
                 How much forgiveness do you think I
                 have in me?

     Welles comes into the kitchen, stands beside Cindy, puts his
     hand out and clasp&#39;s Cindy&#39;s tiny hand.

                             WELLES
                 I can&#39;t talk about it yet... not
                 yet.

     Amy keeps peeling potatoes, refuses to look at him.  Welles
     looks down at Cindy, pats Cindy&#39;s head, looks back at Amy.
     He stands looking at Amy for a long moment.


     EXT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, BACKYARD -- DAY

     Welles wears his fishing cap, pushing his lawn mower, mowing
     his yard.  He has done some healing, though his face is
     still swollen and terribly bruised.

     INT.  KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Welles feeds Cindy with one hand, eating his own dinner with
     the other.  Amy&#39;s across the table, eating, watching them.

     INT.  BASEMENT -- DAY

     Welles works on the WATER HEATER, wrench in hand, reading an
     instruction sheet.  He puts the sheet aside, uses the wrench
     to begin loosening one of the pipe fittings.

     EXT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Welles drags two GARBAGE CANS from the garage to the street,
     leaving them by the mailbox, walking back to the house.

     INT.  BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Welles and Amy are in bed.  Amy&#39;s asleep, on her side,
     facing away from Welles.  Welles lays awake, on his back,
     staring up at the ceiling.

     INT.  SUPERMARKET AISLE -- DAY

     Welles pushes a cart down one aisle.  He looks at his LIST,
     takes a BOX of CEREAL off one shelf, puts it in the cart.

     INT.  SUPERMARKET CHECK-OUT -- DAY

     Welles waits in line with his cart.  It&#39;s a long line.
     He takes out his wallet, opens it.

     In the fold of the wallet, there&#39;s a PHOTO folded into
     quarters.  Welles unfolds it and looks at it dolefully.
     It&#39;s the PHOTO of Mary Anne Mathews, the image Welles
     printed from early in the snuff film.  Sad girl. 

     Welles folds in back up, puts it in another pocket.  He
     looks forward in the line to see if it&#39;s moving.

     EXT.  SUPERMARKET -- DAY

     Welles transfers BAGS of GROCERIES from the shopping cart
     into the back seat of his Ford.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; FORD -- DAY

     Welles drives on the HIGHWAY, groceries in back.  He watches
     the roadway ahead.  There&#39;s little traffic.

     Welles glances down, turns on the RADIO.  Some CLASSICAL
     MUSIC PLAYS.  Welles stares forward through the windshield.

     After a moment, Welles turns the RADIO OFF.  He drives.  The
     ONLY SOUND is the DRONE of the ENGINE and TIRES.

     Welles is suddenly overwhelmed by emotion, eyes filling with
     tears.  He tries to fight it, but can&#39;t help himself.  His
     face contorts with sorrow and he cannot stop crying, letting
     out a loud WAIL of misery...

     EXT.  HIGHWAY -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles&#39; car moves to the shoulder, brakes to a sudden HALT.

     INT.  WELLES&#39; FORD -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

     Welles takes great deep breathes and lets them out, over and
     over again, wiping at his tears.  He lets out a little high-
     pitched WHINE from far back in his throat...

                             WELLES
                 Why... why... ?

     He&#39;s wracked by SOBBING.


     INT.  WELLES&#39; HOUSE, CINDY&#39;S ROOM -- DAY

     Amy&#39;s in a chair, reading a BOOK, not far from Cindy&#39;s crib.
     Cindy&#39;s asleep.  The FRONT DOOR of the house is HEARD
     OPENING and CLOSING from far off in the house.  Amy looks up
     momentarily, then returns to reading.

     FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming through the house, getting
     CLOSER.  Amy looks up from her book.  The bedroom door&#39;s
     open a crack.  The door slowly pushes open.  Welles stands
     there, eyes red from crying.

                             AMY
                 Tom... ?

     Welles comes into the room, stands before Amy.  He gets to
     his knees, puts his head in Amy&#39;s lap, wraps his arms around
     her waist.  Amy holds him, worried, eyes filling with tears.

                             WELLES
                 I have to tell you... I have to tell
                 you what happened.  I have to tell
                 you everything, but we can&#39;t tell
                 anyone else.  No one else can ever
                 know.

     Amy runs her fingers through his hair, bends down to rest
     her head on his back, holding him with her eyes closed.
     Welles holds tighter.

                             WELLES
                 You&#39;re all I&#39;ve got.  You&#39;re all
                 I&#39;ve ever had.
                       (pause)
                 You&#39;re the only one who can save me.






                                the end





   &lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

                           It cost Commander Robert Peary
                           twenty years or unremitting hard-
                           ship and misery to reach the North
                           Pole, finally, in 1909.

                           It would have astounded Peary to
                           learn that, by the late 1950&#39;s
                           and early 60&#39;s, the vast, frozen
                           top-of-the-world he pioneered had

                                       NARRATOR
                           ...but also deep under the ice,
                           in the frigid, five-million-square-
                           mile depths of the Arctic Ocean.


            4     SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CARGO SUB STURGEON - DAY

                  The huge, heavy vessel glides smoothly along, between
                  underwater mountains, following the well-beaten Polar
                  route.

                            Here great passenger and cargo-
                            carrying atomic submarines glided
                            by the dozens, back and forth
                            across the Pole, until a series
                            of mysterious undersea disasters
                            threatened to close the Arctic
                            route forever.


            5     SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE SHOT - STURGEON

                  As it glides, very close, PAST CAMERA, so we can read
                  the name:  U.S.A.S. STURGEON (United States Atom Sub
                  Sturgeon) on the bow.  We may spot the closed-circuit
                  TV camera on the surface of the conning tower.

                                        NARRATOR
                            The decisive moment came May 3, at
                            1315 hours, when the undersea
                            atomic liner, Sturgeon, largest of
                            them all, reached 87 degrees, 10
                            minutes north latitude - only a
                            few miles from the North Pole it-
                            self!


            6     SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - UNDERWATER ICE CAVE - DAY

                  In the depths of it appears a distant, faint ball of
                  glowing light.  The ball begins moving toward CAMERA,
                  slowly, becoming larger and larger.  There may be a
                  FAINT, WEIRD ELECTRICAL HUM just audible from it.


            7     SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CARGO SUB STURGEON

                  It moves ahead, unconscious of impending doom, the Peep-
                  Peep of its sonar impulses now gradually increasing in

            8     SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER - DAY

                  Dimly seen, a vague, indistinct shape (&lt;u&gt;thru&lt;/u&gt; this sequence
                  -- it approaches -- a huge, oval-shaped disc, with what
                  seems to be a revolving turret, or lighthouse, on top.
                  The Peep-Peep of the Sturgeon sonar has now risen to a
                  frantic scream, and the MAGNETIC, LOW-FREQUENCY HUM from
                  the saucer becomes louder and louder

                                                                      3.


            9     SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - PAN SHOT WITH STURGEON

                  The great atom sub glides past camera, but now, as we
                  are shooting from her stern over the bow, we see the
                  screws halt, then go into reverse, and she begins to
                  back away, back TOWARD CAMERA.  Then, in the b.g., we
                  see the saucer, the great, eerie &#39;eye&#39; or whatever it
                  is, looming like a searchlight on her top, and the
                  oval shape seeming like a great mass of glowing energy.
                  The saucer is easily overtaking the reversed Sturgeon,
                  when:


            10    SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER

                  It moves to a position nearly filling screen, when...

                  A great bolt of sheer high-frequency energy - like an
                  undersea lightning bolt - stabs out from somewhere in
                  the saucer, and lances out TOWARD CAMERA.


            11    SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER AND STURGEON

                  The great, stabbing bolt of energy impinges on the hull
                  of the Sturgeon, and for an instant, the entire sub
                  seems to glow with radiant light.  Then, in closer de-
                  tails, we see the effects...


            12    SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - BOW OF STURGEON

                  It seems to melt away (or collapse) like a shell of
                  paraffin over a fire.  The water boils and hisses
                  about it.


            13    SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CONNING TOWER

                  The radio antenna, the periscope, the mast, the tower
                  itself - all seem to melt, and collapse.


            14    SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE STURGEON

                  What is left of the Sturgeon, glowing and hissing,
                  still red hot, begins rising to the surface, towards
                  the ice-layer.


            15    SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER

                  It reverses, draws back into the ice-cave from which
                  it issued.

            16    SPECLAL EFFECT SHOT - ABOVE ICE - DAY

                  And now, she seems to be rising in a tremendous crunch-
                  ing, grinding, writhing activity.  Finally, it breaks
                  completely, and for a moment, the red-hot hull of the
                  Sturgeon is visible in the cracking, grinding masses
                  of ice.  Then, a larger hiss of steam, and finally a
                  ROAR of earthquake volume, a fireball, then a mushroom
                  cloud.  The atomic reactor of the Sturgeon has blown up,
                  the ship is vaporized to nothingness.  As the atomic
                  cloud rises up toward camera...

                            war room.


            21    INT. WAR ROOM - DAY - MATTE SHOT - EST. SHOT

                  This room is, more than anything else, a system of maps
                  and charts - a huge detail of the Arctic ocean occupy-
                  ing an entire wall behind the conference table.  On it
                  are small, magnetic models of submarines, defense
                  stations, etc.  Also, to one side, is a huge globe of
                  the world, on a revolving stand.  File cabinets, rolled
                  maps and charts, shelves of references, navigation
                  guides, etc.  All business; no time wasted on decora-
                  tion.  There is an electric lock on the door; no one
                  can &#39;burst in&#39; on the excuse of making a mistake.


            22    CLOSE SHOT - ADMIRAL TERHUNE

                  The burly, grim-faced Admiral, in uniform, is at the
                  head of the conference table.  There is an intercom
                  on a small stand beside his position at the table.  The
                  Admiral has a sheaf of reports and photographs, also
                  a stack of mimeographed &#39;briefs&#39; at his elbow.  No
                  nonsense; Terhune speaks in clipped, brief phrases,
                  almost as if he has digested sentences down to short,
                  terse bursts before &#39;releasing&#39; them from his lips.
                  The Admiralts lips are moving as we first see him,
                  but we do not hear his speech until the Narrator is
                  finished.

                                        NARRATOR
                            Admiral Terhune, in charge of the
                            Arctic Theater for the Joint Chiefs,
                            well knew the effect the &#39;leak&#39; of
                            any of the explosive information
                            would have on the world civilian
                            population.  So the Admiral was
                            determined:  There would &lt;u&gt;be&lt;/u&gt; no
                            leaks!

            23   FULL SHOT - PAST CONFERENCE TABLE - TOWARD DOOR

                 And now we see Admiral Terhune in the close f.g., and
                 the other participants of the meeting - DR. CLIFFORD KENT,
                 a practical, &#39;egghead&#39; scientist, Chief of Scientific
                 Research and Weapons Development; SIR IAN HUNT, English,
                 winner of the Nobel prize for Oceanography, and Defense
                 Secretary Murdock, distinguished, white-haired.

                 There is a KNOCK.  Admiral Terhune presses the button,
                 the lock BUZZES, and the door opens.

                 COMMANDER WENDOVER steps inside.  He is a hard-bitten,
                 intelligent young-old man of about forty.  Years of
                 responsibility have made him older mentally than physically.
                 He is the highest type of the professional navy man, the
                 elite of the new craft, the atomic submarine.

                 the Admiral&#39;s place at the table, in a TIGHT GROUP SHOT
                 with the other men.

                 They take their seats at the table.  Terhune indicates
                 a place for Wendover; meanwhile, he pulls a sheet of
                 paper from a file folder in front of him.  Looking at
                 them all in turn to command attention, the Admiral says:

                             staff study prepared for the Joint
                             Chiefs: &quot;In our judgment, these Arctic

                  The Admiral looks up expectantly into the faces.

                                       ADMIRAL
                           Now we come to you, Dan.  You

                  The Admiral pulls a cross-section of the Tiger Shark
                  from his pile of documents, uses a pencil to indicate
                  his point as he says:

                  Admiral explains:

                   combination, nicely furnished, with a kitchenette
                   behind a pass-through bar at the other end of the room.
                   This doubles as a bar for mixing drinks.  Empty
                   glasses and the remnants of snacks are scattered about.

                   LIEUTENANT DAVE MILBURN, ex-Naval Academy halfback
                   and inter-collegiate boxing champion, hard-nosed and
                   trigger-tempered, is reluctantly taking leave from
                   Reef&#39;s party.  His pretty, placid wife, HELEN, is
                   indeavoring to get him through the open door and cut
                   his &#39;farewell scene&#39; short.  Dave is slightly, but
                   not objectionably, high.  REEF HOLLOWAY, a handsome,
                   capable, relaxed Annapolis-type, is smiling amiably
                   and bantering with Dave, all the while trying to
                   usher him out with determined speed.  But it is not
                   easy to get Dave through the door.  He is chattering
                   constantly, in a lecturing tone, to someone inside
                   the apartment o.s.

                   accoutered elegantly - with fine legs, long and sexy.
                   Julie is drool-bait, especially for an undersea
                   sailor who only comes up for air and &#39;so forth&#39;
                   every three months.  Julie smiles to herself as she

                   portion of the doorway.

                               Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know
                               you&#39;re exaggerating -
                                       (to Helen)
                               What do you think of this husband
                               of yours?  On most boats a certain

                               Helen.  I appeal to you -

                                   (clutching Dave by both
                                    shoulders and staring him in
                                    the eye)
                               Dave!  Look at me!  I am the mother
                               of your three children!  Now &lt;u&gt;please&lt;/u&gt;
                               take me home to them.  At once!

                   Dave smiles weakly, now feeling the drinks, bows
                   heroically to the room at large, and exits scene
                   under Helen&#39;s guiding arm.  Reef closes the door
                   behind them with an elaborate sigh, then CAMERA
                   PANS WITH HIM into scene with Julie.  She looks up
                   at him impishly and smiles:

                              Dave &lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt; exaggerating.  Just think, a
                              man spends three months in a deep freeze.
                              It&#39;d take his whole shore leave just to
                              thaw him out.  By that time, he&#39;s ready
                              to report back!

                   In a deep, torried kiss on the couch.  Eyes closed,
                   they enthusiastically plumb the depths of feeling, then,
                   at last, reluctantly, they break apart.  Julie sighs
                   deeply.  Reef shakes his head, like a boxer who has
                   sustained a knockout punch, trying to clear it.  CAMERA
                   PULLS BACK for MED. TWO.  Julie, unable to speak for a
                   moment, throws a quick look at Reef, who seems to be
                   gulping for air, then she reaches for a cigarette from
                   a box on the coffee table.  She drops two or three as
                   she fumbles for one and finally gets it in her mouth.

                   Reef picks up a table lighter, strikes it, holds it to
                   her cigarette.  But his arm is trembling so he cannot
                   hold it steady.  Finally, Julie grasps his wrist, holds
                   the flame steady, then contrives to bring the tip of the
                   cigarette in contact with it.  She leans back, takes a
                   deep drag, only now dares to speak.

                                        JULIE
                                      (ruefully)
                               What was I saying...about thawing
                               out icebergs?

                   Reef manages a tiny smile.  Then he observes:

                                        REEF
                               You never can tell about ice-
                               bergs.  Only one-ninth above water.

                   Julie weighs this, then studies Reef appraisingly:

                                        JULIE
                               After that kiss - I&#39;d say that&#39;s
                               about right.

                   Reef snuggles closer to her, slips an arm about her
                   waist, murmurs:

                                        JULIE
                                   (incredulous, dis-

                            Are you &lt;u&gt;kidding&lt;/u&gt;???

                  She takes a couple of rapid puffs, reaches for her
                  drink, takes a long pull at it.

                            wasn&#39;t just...accidental, our
                            getting together?

                            Isn&#39;t the next chorus something
                            about:  &#39;Let&#39;s not waste one
                            precious golden moment - any
                            second, there could be a knock
                            on the door, and -

                  Reef covers her mouth with his fingertips, murmurs:

                            Stranger things have happened,

                  He snaps his fingers.  Now Julie covers &lt;u&gt;his&lt;/u&gt; lips,
                  murmurs with unmistakable import:

                                        JULIE
                            Then by all &lt;u&gt;means&lt;/u&gt;, let&#39;s not
                            waste time!

                  And she kisses &lt;u&gt;him&lt;/u&gt; - hard, enthusiastically.  Immedi-
                  ately, happ1ly, Reef enters into the spirit of the
                  thing.

                            What&#39;s that pounding?

                  Reef, eyes still closed, takes her hand, places it over
                  his heart.

                                        REEF

            38   OVER SHOULDERS OF REEF AND JULIE - DOWN AT FLOOR

                 And now Julie, looking over Reef&#39;s shoulder, sees an
                 envelope pushed under the door from the hall outside.
                 She reacts, taps him on the shoulder.

                                        JULIE
                                     (insistently)
                              Reef - look!

                 Reluctantly, he turns, sees the envelope.  He frowns at
                 her.  With extreme reluctance, he goes to the door,
                 stoops down, picks up the envelope, removes the contents.
                 Julie waits anxiously.

                 Suddenly, Reef grasps the significance, slaps his fore-
                 head in exasperation.

                                         REEF
                              Oh no!

                              What&#39;s wrong?

                 She jumps up, goes over to him, grasps his wrist, looks
                 at the papers.  She, too, reacts, as Reef tragically slaps
                 his forehead again, looks regretfully at her - this lovely,
                 willing morsel.

                                         REEF

                  very grim-faced, very disgusted, climbs out, takes his

                                    (not satisfied)
                             I don&#39;t like it.  This is all mighty
                             funny -

                             Suppose you get aboard, anyway, huh?

                  Disgruntled, Chester passes through the gate, as Griff
                  checks him off on the roster and grins after him.

            44    FULL SHOT - THE CON

                  Dave Milburn is already busy checking the equipment.
                  The other seamen are preparing the boat for sea.  Reef
                  turns to Wendover.

                                  I think I&#39;ll stow my gear.

                  But Wendover, with a peculiar look, frowns, and says:

                                  You&#39;ll have to share quarters,
                                  this trip.

                  Now Reef is down below deck level.  Wendover turns
                  towards Dave.  Wendover shrugs helplessly.  Dave re-
                  turns it.

                                        WENDOVER
                                   (checking the plot

                            Right, Skipper.

                  He goes to work, as Wendover smiles peculiarly at the
                  bulkhead door through which Reef just passed.

                  It is only stuck on by scotch tape, below the normal

                            Carl!  You - !


            49    TWO SHOT - REEF AND CARL NEILSEN

                  CARL NEILSEN has the look of an ascetic - thin, sensi-
                  tive features, a nervous, intense manner - the &#39;egg-
                  head&#39; appearance.  He turns, reacts to Reef&#39;s presence.
                  He is smoking a cigarette in rapid, nervous puffs.
                  Reef sinks, disgusted onto the bunk.

                                        REEF
                            I should have suspectcd, when
                            I heard that &#39;Doctor.&#39;  I thought
                            it was your father.

                                        CARL
                            It was supposed to be.  Dad had
                            a heart attack, two days ago.

                                        CARL
                            It was moderate.  He&#39;ll be
                            all right.
                                   (then)
                            But it was out of the question,
                            his coming along.

                            place the Skipper?

                  Carl displays a trace of anger for the first time.

                                        CARL
                            There was no choice.  Dad and I
                            developed the Lungfish together.
                            Except for him, I&#39;m the only one
                            qualified to dive in it.

                                   (then, earnestly)

                            to come?  If it didn&#39;t mean
                            so much to Dad - proving his
                            depth-explorer - it&#39;s the last
                            thing I&#39;d want!

                  Reef&#39;s lip curls contemptuously.  He mutters slowly,
                  angrily:

                                        REEF
                            &lt;u&gt;That&lt;/u&gt; I can believe!

                  Carl drops his eyes at the intensity of Reef&#39;s stare.
                  He turns to his gear, begins unpacking his essentials.
                  Reef shakes his head vaguely, worriedly.

                  assembled.  Griff has a microphone ready for the
                  Captain, as he enters.

                  Wendover sits down, as Griff steps back a pace or two.
                  Wendover takes out his sealed orders, opens them,
                  glances through them, then hands them to Reef.

                                      WENDOVER
                              These are our orders, Reef.  Better

                  Wendover clicks off the mike, hands it to Griff,
                  who solemnly hangs it up.  Dave heaves a deep sigh,

                  Reef, grim, his face frozen, hands the orders back
                  to Wendover.

                  Wendover spreads his hands helplessly.  Kent is still
                  frowning at the view screen.

                                        KENT
                            It doesn&#39;t seem possible, but -

            101   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - TIGER SHARK

                  (This may also intercut earlier dialogue)

                  It seems to be buffeted by an underwater storm.  The
                  scene is lit by underwater lightning bolts, crashes like
                  exploding skyrockets, the sub is tossed about like a
                  chip.  Finally, when it seems that nothing can survive
                  the electrical barrage, we see the nose tilt down steeply,
                  and the Shark glides deeper and deeper into the depths.

                  As it noses deeper and deeper into the depths, the bolts
                  of lightning seem to follow it down, probing after it.
                  But at last, the bolts are left behind, the turbulent
                  waters are calm, the crashing noise subsides.  Then we
                  see that the sub is almost on the bottom.  At last, it

                                        SIR IAN
                            It is rather fantastic -

                  Sir Ian hesitates.  Then, from beside his chair, he
                  picks up a large, rolled chart.  He unties the string
                  binding it.

                                        SIR IAN
                            Here is a chart of the Arctic
                            region.  On it I have plotted
                            every instance of these strange
                            phenomena - sinkings, electrical
                            storms, our own experiences...

                  He unrolls the chart on the table top.  Reef and Wendover
                  exchange a perplexed look.  Then they get up, come around,
                  peer down over Sir Ian&#39;s shoulder at the chart.  Sir Ian,
                  with a pencil, gestures on the chart.


            109   INSERT - CLOSEUP - THE CHART OF THE ARCTIC

                  And as Sir Ian&#39;s pencil moves, we see a circle of &#39;X&#39;s&#39;
                  about the North Pole, equidistant from it, each marked
                  with a date, and, in print too fine to be read, the
                  circumstances.  As he points to one, in the Bering
                  Straits...

                            through the points of occurrence
                            makes almost a complete circle...

                            I cannot accept the idea that
                            these phenomena were either
                            random, &lt;u&gt;or&lt;/u&gt; natural.

                  The others react, Wendover and Reef exchange a look,

                  On the screen is a great, oval-shaped, glowing ellipse-
                  saucer-shaped.  It is perhaps three-hundred feet in

                  remotely resembling a lighthouse beacon - seemingly the
                  &#39;eye&#39; of the thing.  Beneath it are some sort of pro-
                  tuberances, perhaps a landing or settling gear.  While

                            Just musing about our &#39;one-eyed
                            adversary&#39; and the legend of
                            Homer.
                                   (to the group)
                            &#39;Cyclopes&#39; were the Sons of
                            Heaven, who forged the thunder-
                            bolts thrown by Zeus.

                                        WENDOVER
                                   (grimly)
                            Our &#39;Cyclops&#39; throws quite a
                            thunderbolt, itself!

                  Now Dr. Kent appears in the doorway, carrying a well-
                  filled briefcase, from which he has extracted a manila
                  folder.

                                        KENT
                                   (with satis-
                                   faction)
                            I knew there was something
                            familiar -

                  He puts down the briefcase, takes an 8 x 10 photograph
                  from the manila folder, then lays the folder aside.
                  He tosses the photograph on the table.

                                        KENT
                            Take a look.

                  They peer at it curiously, then someone lays Sir Ian&#39;s
                  sketch alongside it.


            154   INSERT - CLOSEUP - THE PHOTO AND SKETCH

                  And we see that the object in the photo - a &#39;flying
                  saucer&#39; - closely resembles the sketch.

                                        KENT O.S.
                            The picture was taken by an
                            amateur astronomer, over
                            New Mexico.

                            Board, for UFO reports.

                  As Sir Ian looks up inquiringly, Carl explains:

                            in the sky - not under water?

                  Sir Ian picks up the photo, studies it as he reflects:

                            This would explain why there
                            were never any reports of land-
                            ings.  It&#39;s possible that who-
                            ever - or whatever - inhabits
                            the craft is not a land creature,
                            but a form of marine life.

                            the next report of trouble.  Then

                            the Tiger Shark cruised almost
                            over the North Pole, waiting

                            One mayday, then...nothing.

                  Dave is working over his navigation chart. The tension
                  in the Con is electric.  Dave takes a compass, swings a
                  pair of arcs on the chart, looks up to announce:

                                   (grimly)
                            And stand by for action!

                  Reef hurries to the far end of the torpedo room, and be-
                  gins climbing the ladder.  He glances back to see that
                  Griff and another man are manipulating dials to open
                  the inner tube doors.

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:


            185   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - EXT. OF TIGER SHARK - CLOSE ON
                  TORPEDO TUBES

                  as we see the outer doors slowly lift, disclosing the
                  torpedo warheads inside.


            186   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - FULL SHOT - PAST DAVE IN F.G.

                  as Dave sings out:

                            Range:  Now fifteen miles!

                  Now Reef climbs up into the con, demands:

                                        REEF
                            You&#39;re sure it&#39;s Cyclops?

                                        WENDOVER
                                   (gesturing toward

                            Take a look.

                  Reef comes over, stares, fascinated, down over Dave&#39;s
                  shoulder.


            187   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OPTICAL SHOT - VIEW SCREEN

                  And now, in the TV screen, we can just make out the
                  faint outlines of the approaching saucer - the oval
                  shape, the glowing turret-eye.  O.s., Dave now sings
                  out:

                                        DAVE (o.s.)

            188   TWO SHOT - DAVE AND REEF

                  as they look down anxiously at the screen.  Now there
                  is a VOICE over the intercom:

            190   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE CYCLOPS - MOVING TOWARD CAMERA

                  Through an undersea valley, the Cyclops moves silently,
                  its glowing eye probing ahead for possible danger.


            191   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK

                  still lying silently, in wait.


            192   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CYCLOPS - MOVING DIRECTLY TOWARD
                  CAMERA

                  It is approaching very near, now.

                  ENDING on Dave and Reef.  Now Dave sings out:

            194   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OVER TIGER SHARK - AT CYCLOPS

                  This is the first tie-in shot, showing the relative posi-
                  tions of the two craft.  The Cyclops should still be a
                  considerable distance away - merely a glowing spot in the
                  water.


            195   INT. TORPEDO ROOM - DAY - PANNING OVER TENSE FACES OF

                  Griff stands near the firing buttons for tubes One and
                  Two - clearly labeled.  The tension is building.

                  SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT

                  And on it, we see that Dave has adjusted cross-hairs for
                  the Target Zero.  The saucer moves across the view
                  screen, toward the Target Zero.

                                        DAVE (o.s.)

            197   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CYCLOPS

                  It looms huge and awesome IN CAMERA, now, sweeps by and
                  above CAMERA and o.s.  There is an awful RUSHING SOUND
                  as it sweeps overhead.

            199   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OPTICAL SHOT - VIEW SCREEN

                  The Cyclops approaches closer and closer to the &#39;x.&#39;

                                         DAVE (o.s.)
                            ....eight...seven.....six....

            201   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OPTICAL SHOT - VIEW SCREEN

                  And now the Cyclops moves directly into the cross of the
                  &#39;x.&#39;

                                         DAVE (o.s.)

            203   INT. TORPEDO ROOM - DAY - MED. SHOT - GRIFF AND OTHERS

                  as Griff moves swiftly, presses the firing lever, then
                  barks into intercom:

                                        GRIFF
                            Number One fired!


            204   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE ON TORPEDO TUBE

                  as the first torpedo bursts out and speeds away toward
                  target.


            205   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - GROUP SHOT

                                        WENDOVER

            206   INT. TORPEDO ROOM - DAY - MED. SHOT - GRIFF AND OTHERS

                  Griff fires Number Two, then reports:

                            Number Two fired!


            207   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE ON TORPEDO TUBE

                  as the second torpedo shoots from its tube after the
                  first.


            208   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - TYING TIGER SHARK AND CYCLOPS

                  And now we see the two torpedos, executing a great
                  curving arc, &#39;homing&#39; on their target.  They are
                  still a considerable distance from it.


            209   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE ON TWO TORPEDOS

                  as they WHOOSH BY CAMERA, speeding toward their target.


            210   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - TIGHT SHOT - ABOUT DAVE AND
                  WENDOVER

                  Wendover checks his watch, demands of Reef:

                            Thirty-four seconds!

                  All wait, tense, breathless, expectant.

                  Carl, the crew, Griff and others, all silently counting
                  the seconds.


            212   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER

                  Now the luminous eye seems to turn to observe the ap-
                  proaching menace.  There is a THROBBING BUZZ as of an
                  energy discharge, and then the first torpedo comes in
                  scene, seems to swerve to avoid the Cyclops, goes
                  plunging on past it and o.s.


            213   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - SHOOTING PAST DAVE - AT VIEW
                  PLATE - AT OTHERS

                  as Dave, agony and disappointment in his tone, calls:

                                        DAVE
                            Number One...Missed!

                  There is an AD LIB response of shock.  Then Wendover
                  complains to Reef:

                                        WENDOVER
                            How could it?  We were dead on
                            target, with a homing torpedo!


            214   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER - CLOSE

                  Now, from some vent within the vehicle, a cloud of radi-
                  ant, luminescent &#39;jelly&#39; seems to stream out, enveloping
                  it in a protective cloud.  Just as the cloud is well-
                  formed about the saucer, obscuring its outlines...


            215   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE ON SECOND TORPEDO

                  It plunges through scene and off towards the saucer.

            216   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - AT SAUCER

                  as the second torpedo burrows into the protective cloud,
                  more and more slowly, probing vainly toward the still-
                  visible &#39;eye.&#39;  Then...


            217   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE ON TORPEDO

                  as it buries itself in the mass of luminescent jelly.
                  The propellers thrash madly, ineffectually.  Then,
                  gradually, they slow down, and the torpedo is completely
                  surrounded by the mysterious mass.

                  THE TV SCREEN - OPTICAL SHOT

                  AND OVERLAPPING ACTION ABOVE, we see the torpedo slow
                  down and stop, buried in the mass surrounding the saucer.

                                        DAVE (o.s.)
                            Skipper - look at this!


            219   TIGHT GROUP SHOT - LOW ANGLE - UP INTO FACES

                  as Reef, Wendover, Kent and Sir Ian cluster tightly
                  about Dave.  Carl enters from the hatch, joins them.

                                        DAVE

                            A mass of jelly-like stuff came
                            out of the thing, and caught our
                            torpedo!

                                        WENDOVER
                                   (exclaims)
                            What???

                  Kent frowns, points.

                                        KENT
                            It must function like a de-Gaussing
                            field.
                                   (dubiously)
                            We&#39;ll never get a torpedo through
                            that!

                  Now Wendover&#39;s jaw sets grimly.

                                        WENDOVER
                            Maybe not a &lt;u&gt;torpedo&lt;/u&gt;...

                  They look at him as he moves o.s. to the intercom.

                                                                       80.


            220   CLOSE SHOT - WENDOVER

                  as he barks into the intercom:

                            What course, Skipper?

                            Right at our one-eyed friend!

                  There are AD LIB surprised exclamations from all.  Reef
                  is incredulous:

                                        REEF
                            Right &lt;u&gt;at&lt;/u&gt; him?

                                        WENDOVER
                            That&#39;s what I said!

                                        REEF
                            But - what can we accomplish?

                                        WENDOVER
                            We can &lt;u&gt;ram&lt;/u&gt; him!

                  The others exchange quick, frightened looks.  Dave is
                  incredulous.  Carl moves over to Wendover, admonishes
                  quietly:

                                        CARL
                            You&#39;ve weighed the consequences,
                            Captain - the lives involved?

                  Reef glares at him.

                                        WENDOVER
                            Doctor -- I&#39;ve weighed the lives
                            Cyclops has taken, already...and
                            &lt;u&gt;will&lt;/u&gt; take, in the future, unless
                            &lt;u&gt;we&lt;/u&gt; can stop him, now!

                                        CARL
                            We might find other means...

                                        WENDOVER
                            &lt;u&gt;What&lt;/u&gt; other means?  If the Tiger
                            Shark can&#39;t destroy him, no power
                            on &lt;u&gt;Earth&lt;/u&gt; can!  Now brave yourselves!

                  Carl subsides, catches Reef&#39;s eye, looks away.

            224   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK - ON BOTTOM

                  Now it begins to rise slowly from its bed in the depths.
                  Water pours from the ballast tanks.  Then, with the boat
                  floating free in the water...


            225   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE SHOT - SCREWS

                  as they begin to churn, picking up speed, then, finally,
                  churn the water into a foamy wake.


            226   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK

                  Like a great, predatory fish, it rises from the bottom,
                  moving more and more swiftly.  It makes a great climbing
                  turn directly TOWARD CAMERA, then goes overhead and out,
                  speeding toward the saucer.


            227   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - REACTION SHOTS - PRINCIPALS

                  They are all braced against the impending crash.


            228   CLOSE SHOT - WENDOVER

                  as he speaks into the intercom.

                                        WENDOVER

            230   INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM - DAY - MED. FULL SHOT

                  as Griff AD LIBS orders for the men to lie in their
                  bunks, brace themselves against structural members,
                  etc.


            231   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - TIGER SHARK

                  It has climbed to a level with the saucer, now levels
                  off.  It is picking up speed.


            232   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - CLOSE SHOT - DAVE

                  He adjusts the TV view screen, tenses for the shock.
                  Reef appears just behind him.  They exchange a grim
                  look, then eye the screen, fascinated.


            233   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OPTICAL SHOT - THE TV SCREEN

                  Now we see the saucer looming up hugely, directly ahead.


            234   CLOSE THREE SHOT - WENDOVER, KENT AND SIR IAN

                  as we hear Dave&#39;s voice:

                            three...two...


            235   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - SAUCER AND TIGER SHARK

                  as they meet.  The Tiger Shark plows into the protective
                  jelly, which slows but cannot stop the juggernaut.


            236   CLOSER CUTS - TIGER SHARK

                  plowing into the protective jelly.


            237   FULL SHOT - THE CRASH

                  as the Tiger Shark, unstoppable, plows inexorably through
                  the protective coating, slams against the saucer itself,

            237   (CONTINUED)

                  then buries its bow deep within the Cyclops - like a har-
                  poon driving into a huge creature of the depths.  Perhaps
                  a third of the Shark&#39;s length is driven deep into the
                  saucer.  Tremendous RENDING, TEARING NOISES accompany the
                  crash, after which...complete, eerie silence.


            238   CLOSER CUTS - THE CRASH

                  As the bow rends the outer envelope of the saucer, the
                  screws of the Tiger Shark churn powerfully against the
                  restraining jelly...then a CLOSE SHOT of the Cyclops&#39;
                  &#39;eye&#39; shows the glow diminishing.


            239   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OVER
                  DAVE&#39;S SHOULDER - AT TV SCREEN

                  And we see the situation, that the nose of the Shark is
                  buried deep within the saucer.

                                        DAVE
                                   (triumphantly)

                            into him!


            240   GROUP SHOT - ABOUT DAVE - UP INTO FACES

                  as Wendover manages a grim, satisfied smile.  Kent and
                  Sir Ian eagerly check the view plate, and the gauges.

                                        REEF
                            Speared him like a fish!

                  Wendover moves to the intercom, announces:

            243   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - TIGER SHARK AND CYCLOPS

                  Jammed together, they are sinking slowly in the water.


            244   CLOSER SHOTS - THE PROPELLERS

                  Overcoming the initial resistance of the jelly, they
                  begin slowly turning.


            245   FULL SHOT - TIGER SHARK AND CYCLOPS

                  It is obvious, now, that they are headed for the
                  bottom.


            246   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - FULL SHOT

                  The room seems to vibrate as the mighty atomic reactor
                  turbines exert full power on the propellers.  Then Reef
                  shakes his head, discouraged.

                                        REEF

                  The dial moves rapidly.  Now it is at 175 fathoms, rapid-
                  ly moves to 180.


            248   PAST DAVE AND WENDOVER - AT OTHERS

                  as Wendover, momentarily puzzled, remarks:

                            A hundred and eighty fathoms!

                            running in reverse, they&#39;re

                            right to the bottom.

                                  (frowns at gauge)

                                   and order)
                            Stop engines!

                  Reef repeats the command into the intercom:

                  sinking through the water, pulled lower and lower by
                  the Shark&#39;s engines.  Now the propellers stop.  The
                  two craft still continue sinking, but more slowly now.

                  Present are Wendover, Carl, Reef, Kent, Sir Ian and Dave.
                  This is a grim, hopeless conclave.  The silence, except
                  for a faint trickle of water somewhere, is complete,
                  eerie, ghastly.  Faces are bathed in tense perspiration.
                  Wendover shakes his head.

                            If anyone has &lt;u&gt;any&lt;/u&gt; more ideas...

                  Now Reef explains an idea he has been toying with:

                            cut the Shark loose?

                            That&#39;s all very fine, young man.
                            But how would one go about &lt;u&gt;get&lt;/u&gt;-
                            &lt;u&gt;ting&lt;/u&gt; inside Cyclops?

                  Reef takes a deep breath, throws a glance at Carl, then
                  says:

                                        REEF
                            Through the eye - with the
                            Depth-Explorer!

                  Carl seizes this eagerly.

                                        CARL
                            Yes - the Explorer was &lt;u&gt;built&lt;/u&gt; to
                            operate at even greater depths --

                                        WENDOVER
                                   (disturbed)
                            But suppose there isn&#39;t an atmos-
                            phere inside the saucer?

                                        REEF
                                   (bluntly)
                            Then the idea&#39;s no good.  But
                            we&#39;re no worse off than we are
                            right now.

                  Dave picks this up eagerly.

                                        DAVE
                            You&#39;ve got to let us try, Skipper --

                                   (ignoring him)
                            Reef and I can take the Explorer
                            down, clamp it around the eye,
                            and ---

                                        CARL
                                   (firmly)
                            No, you can&#39;t.  But &lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt; can --
                                   (to Reef)
                            I can deliver you to the eye.
                            Then you --

                  Carl bridles angrily.

                                        CARL
                            That&#39;s enough, Holloway.  I&#39;ve
                            told you before, wearing boards
                            on your shoulders, and parading
                            with a stiff spine doesn&#39;t auto-
                            matically endow you with back-

                            of Captain Neilsen does!

                  Wendover is watching this exchange with growing dis-
                  pleasure.

                                        CARL
                            However our ideas disagree, as
                            I&#39;ve said before, I&#39;m &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; a
                            coward!  And it happens you&#39;ve
                            got no choice:  Either &lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt; take
                            you down there, in the Lungfish,
                            or you don&#39;t get there -

                                   (to Reef)
                            It so happens Dr. Neilsen&#39;s
                            right.  The odds are long
                            enough, without making them
                            longer.
                                   (he turns to Carl)
                            Get the Explorer in the airlock,
                            ready for launching.

                  Carl nods.  Throwing a final look at Reef, he goes to
                  the passage way, climbs down.  Wendover turns back to
                  Reef, suggests:

                            With their underwater experience,
                            they&#39;ll be invaluable.  Take
                            sidearms, and flare pistols --

                                        WENDOVER
                                   (holding up crossed

                            We hope!

                  Wendover holds out his hands, shakes both theirs.
                  Reef turns to Dave.

                            Let&#39;s get ready.

                  They head for the passage way and exit.  Wendover looks
                  at Sir Ian and Kent, shakes his head solemnly.

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

            253   INT. TORPEDO ROOM - DAY - FULL SHOT - AT AIRLOCK

                  We see the single hatch open, in which the Depth Explorer
                  has been mounted.  Carl, in a jumper and helmet, waits
                  by the step with Powell and Carney, dressed in their
                  rubber suits, with helmets and face plates.  They carry
                  breathing apparatus.  Behind them, Dave and Reef appear,
                  dressed similarly, carrying &lt;u&gt;their&lt;/u&gt; equipment - portable
                  torches, a bag of tools, sidearms, flare pistols, and...
                  in Dave&#39;s case...a machine pistol (burp gun).  Over
                  this:

                                        NARRATOR
                            Preparations consumed only an
                            hour.  At 1100, everything was
                            ready for this last, desperate
                            attempt.

                  Now the four men join Carl at the airlock.  Carl is
                  tense, tight-lipped.  Reef frowns, concerned.

                                        REEF
                            There&#39;s still time.  You could
                            show me how...?

                  Carl shakes his head firmly, gestures toward the hatch.

                                        CARL
                            Get in.

                  the action of the five men climbing down hatch (into
                  Explorer).  When all are inside, Griff steps forward,
                  closes the hatch.  Then he closes the airlock, and
                  goes to intercom.

                  Wendover glances once at Kent and Sir Ian.  Then he
                  moves to the mike.

                                        WENDOVER

            256   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - BELLY OF TIGER SHARK

                  Now we see the lock door slide open.  A moment later,
                  the Depth-Explorer moves out through the opening, like
                  an animal being born.  It hovers for a moment, just
                  below the Shark.  Then it maneuvers o.s. towards the
                  Cyclops.

                  GROUP SHOT

                  Carl operates the controls.  The five men are wedged in
                  shoulder to shoulder.  Reef makes a gesture of direc-
                  tion.  Carl nods, complies.


            258   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE CYCLOPS

                  Now the Depth-Explorer moves into frame, drifts directly
                  toward the great &#39;eye&#39; - which still has a faint glow.


            259   CLOSE SHOT - AT CYCLOPS&#39; EYE - SPECIAL EFFECTS SHOT

                  The Depth-Explorer moves up with its hatch clamped
                  magnetically, directly over the eye.


            260   INT. DEPTH-EXPLORER

                  as Dave turns to Reef.

                                in case.

                  The others all apply oxygen tubes to their mouths, go
                  down hatch, Reef picking up a large tool like a wrecking
                  bar.

           260A   UNDER HATCH

                  Reef and Dave come down hatch into scene.  We see the
                  iris and Reef goes to work on it with the tool.

                                                               WIPE TO:

           261    INSERT - CLOSE UP - FITTING OF EYE

                  as Reef&#39;s tools batter at it.  Suddenly, it gives away.

           262    SHOOTING AT EYE

                  as, suddenly, it SEEMS TO OPEN, LIKE A CAMERA IRIS,
                  leaving a circular opening, big enough to crawl through.

           262A   REACTION - DAVE &amp; REEF

                  Now Reef sniffs at the atmosphere that pours in from

          276     INT. GLOBE - DAY - SPECIAL EFFECTS SHOT

                  Though we see nothing of its construction at this
                  point.

          276A    INSERT - CLOSE SHOT - PROBING SPINES - TRICK SHOT
                                                   (SPECIAL EFFECTS)

                  The black, catfish-or-sea urchin-like spines seem
                  to rise from limp supineness.  They stiffen, grope
                  like fingers, move towards a series of grommet-like
                  openings in the translucent wall of the sphere.  Now
                  a spine nears a grommet, slips into it, apparently
                  making &#39;contact&#39;, for somewhere, a FAINT LIGHT comes
                  on, and the scene becomes lighter.  In a moment,
                  another spine slips into another grommet-hole.

            277   INT. CHAMBER SECTION - DAY - MED. SHOT - A LIGHT

                  To an accompanying tympany BEAT, a LIGHT SPOT, appears.
                  A moment later, another drum beat, another LIGHT SPOT.
                  (Note:  This business may continue behind subsequent
                  dialogue - more beats, more lights coming on)


            278   CLOSE GROUP - THE WORKING PARTY - ABOUT RAM OF TIGER
                  SHARK

                  As Reef continues working with the torch.  Dave pushes
                  up his goggles, reacts, surprised.  He taps Reef on the
                  shoulder.

                                        DAVE
                            Hey - you know somethin&#39;?  It&#39;s
                            getting lighter in here!

                            You know - it &lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt;?

                  Now they give a sudden lurch.  Dave looks down at his
                  feet, then into Reef&#39;s face.

                                        DAVE
                            And if I didn&#39;t &lt;u&gt;know&lt;/u&gt; better - I&#39;d

                            Let&#39;s get back to work, and maybe
                            we &lt;u&gt;will&lt;/u&gt; be, soon.

                  A grim reaction, all around.

                  as, now, the last of them contact their proper control
                  points, and a complete circuit of lights FLASHES ON.
                  The LIGHT INTENSITY rises.


            282   INT. CHAMBER SECTION - DAY - GROUP SHOT - THE MEN

                  working on the ram.  Now, with a final cut with the
                  torch, there is a CLANG, A RINGING SOUND, and then
                  the ram drops free.

                            can pull clear!

                  Now, we hear a weird, mechanical voice:

                            Commander Holloway!  Listen!

                  Reef reacts.

                            You hear that?

                            The sound again?

                  Now the voice repeats:

                                        SAUCER-VOICE
                            Commander Holloway.  Make no

                            my name!

                  Reef draws his gun and Dave raises his machine gun.

            284   MED. GROUP SHOT

                  And now the voice comes from another quarter:

                                        SAUCER-VOICE
                            You will see that avails nothing!

                  Reef looks around, startled.


            285   PAN SHOT - WITH POWELL

                  His nerve is going.  He edges away from the group, then
                  turns to bolt out of scene, heading for the Depth-
                  Explorer.  But just as he takes his first steps...

                  As he stumbles through the darkness.

          286A    FLASH OF LIGHT

                  A flash of light comes down at Powell from somewhere.

          287     CLOSEUP - POWELL

                  The light envelops him, and he cringes.

                               Carney - help!

                  Reacting to Powell&#39;s cry.

                  Carney moves o.s.

          287B    CLOSEUP - POWELL - MAKEUP SHOT

                  We see the horrible effect of the light on his face.

          287C    TRICK EFFECT - POWELL SHRIVELLED - PRODUCTION SHOT

                  Powell is shrivelled by the light.  The last thing we
                  see of him is...

          287D    TRICK EFFECT - POWELL&#39;S HANDS - SPECIAL EFFECTS SHOT

                  They disintegrate to Jelly, and Powell is completely

          288     PANNING WITH CARNEY

                  As he reaches the spot where Powell was killed.  He
                  reacts, horrified.

          288A    PANNING WITH CARNEY

                  As he moves away hurriedly.

          288B    PANNING WITH CARNEY

                  As he turns, from the blackness, a burst of steam
                  issues forth into his face.

          288C    CLOSEUP - CARNEY

                  He screams as the steam envelops him and sinks out
                  of scene.

                  They come clambering down the ramp, reach the platform
                  level.  Then, awed, they look around them.


            291   EST. SHOT ON FLOOR (PLATFORM) - CAVERNOUS INTERIOR -
                  BACK AT TINY MEN ON PLATFORM - MATTE SHOT

                  We see a long, slender bridge, or catwalk, extending
                  out into space, apparently reaching toward a great,
                  opalescent sphere that seems to hang suspended on
                  cushioning points, some sort of shock-absorbing system,
                  in the very center of the saucer.  A weird GLOW, seem-
                  ing to become ever brighter, emanates from inside this
                  sphere.


            292   TWO SHOT - DAVE AND REEF

                  Awed, round-eyed, silent, they stare open-mouthed at

                  But Reef is too intent on the voice.  Now he begins dis-
                  arming as Dave looks incredulous.

                                        DAVE

                  OPENING appears in the side of the sphere.

                            It wants me to come alone.

                                        DAVE
                                   (flaring)
                            Oh it does???

                  Reef moves o.s. toward the bridge.  Dave waits, very
                  unwillingly.


            295   INT. SECTION OF BRIDGE - LEADING TO SPHERE - DAY -
                  REEF - ONTO BLACK

                  He inches his way tortuously across the slender support,
                  toward the iris opening.


            296   MATTE SHOT - BEHIND REEF - TOWARD SPHERE

                  He crawls cautiously towards the opening.


            296A  INT. PLATFORM - BLACK BACKING - DAY - CLOSE SHOT - DAVE

                  Angry, impatient, he sets Reef&#39;s weapons down.  Then he
                  clutches his submachine gun, watches Reef o.s.


            297   INT. SPHERE - DAY - MED. SHOT - FROM INSIDE - IRIS
                  OPENING

                  Now Reef appears, crawls cautiously up into the opening,
                  then stands, looks inside.  His eyes nearly start from
                  his head as he takes in the incredible sight.


            298   TRICK SHOT - FROM REEF&#39;S P.O.V. - INTERIOR OF SPHERE -

                  His eyes range over the ceiling of the glove, then as he
                  shifts his gaze to the bottom of the sphere, we see &#39;it&#39;
                  - a horrendous organism, like a giant sea urchin, the
                  long, black, writhing spines now all in proper contact

                  with their grommet-sockets.  And out of the center of
                  the pulsating central &#39;body&#39; rises a long stalk, and on
                  the very tip of it a great, glowing &#39;eye.&#39;  The setup
                  is like a monstrous rendering of the eye of a snail.


            299   MATTE SHOT - UP PAST &#39;EYE&#39; AT REEF IN IRIS

                  So he appears a tiny, miniature man compared to the
                  cavernous size of the sphere.  And now, apparently
                  from the &#39;eye&#39; itself, which seems to flicker and
                  glow like an electron beam spectrometer, comes the
                  saucer-voice again:

                            express it - we meet &#39;face to

            300   CLOSE SHOT - REEF

                  As he says with sardonic inflection:

                  He cannot contain himself any longer, is now crawling
                  out onto the bridge, toward Reef; cradling the sub-
                  machine gun on his forearm as he goes.

            300E  CLOSE SHOT - REEF

                  He looks a bit bewildered:

                  Now, to Reef&#39;s consternation, Dave suddenly appears be-

                            What - ?

                  Then, Dave&#39;s mouth drops open, and he stares, incredulous.

            300G  TWO SHOT - DAVE AND REEF

                  As Dave, before Reef can stop him, steps forward
                  belligerently, levels and submachine gun down at the
                  creature.

                                        DAVE
                                   (menacingly)
                            So this is &#39;headquarters,&#39; huh?

                            you....

                  And he looses a burst with the sub-machine gun, so that
                  we don&#39;t hear the appropriate name.

            305   MED. CLOSE SHOT - REEF

                  as he says grimly, threateningly:

            306   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE &#39;EYE&#39; OF THE ORGANISM

                  as the flare strikes it and bursts.  There is a SCREAM,
                  an unearthly, shattering WAIL from the organism itself.


            307   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE ON &#39;EYE&#39;

                  as the flare burns a hole in the iris, and the water,
                  or whatever it contains, seems to drain from it, like
                  a plastic bag when it is torn.


            308   CLOSE SHOT - REEF

                  He reacts quickly, astonished at the effect of his
                  shot.  But then he wastes no time - turns and scrambles
                  back out.  SCREAMS OF PAIN from the creature follow
                  him.


            309   INT. SECTION OF BRIDGE - DAY - FAST PAN - WITH REEF

                  Heedless of the danger of falling, he scrambles madly
                  back across the bridge.  Beams of the death-dealing
                  light just miss him as he goes, and SCREAMS from the
                  wounded creature shatter the cavernous silence.


            310   (OMITTED)


            310A  PANNING WITH REEF

                  He reaches the platform, races madly for the ramp.
                  Beams of light again just miss him.


            310B  PANNING WITH REEF - UP RAMP

                  And suddenly, as he reaches the iris, he YELLS with
                  pain, his foot caught in the iris.

                  CARL&#39;S SHOULDER

                  Carl reacts as the iris begins closing.  Quickly, he
                  grabs a crowbar, or other prop, wedges it into the
                  iris, holding it open momentarily.  A moment later,
                  Reef literally hurls himself into the little sub,
                  slams the hatch behind him, and exclaims:

                                    REEF
                             Back to the Shark - right
                             now!

                  Carl does not hesitate, begins working the controls.

                                    CARL
                             What about Dave - and the

                  Carl frowns.  Now Reef grasps the radio microphone, says
                  quickly:

                  as Wendover nods, responding to the radio message.

                                        WENDOVER
                            All right, Reef.

                  He turns to the intercom, orders:

                                        WENDOVER
                            Reactor Room!  This is the Skipper!

            314   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK PROPELLERS

                  They begin to turn, slowly at first, then picking up
                  speed.


            315   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - SHARK AND DEPTH-EXPLORER

                  It moves away from the saucer, back up through the water
                  to the belly of the Shark, at the airlock.

                  And now we see, through a SERIES OF DISSOLVES that the
                  eye is healing - restoring itself, like a balloon being
                  blown up (maybe this would do it).


            317   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE &#39;FINGERS&#39;

                  Purposefully they probe into the &#39;circuit&#39; apertures,
                  and the power lights begin to glow radiantly.

            318   INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM - DAY - FULL SHOT - AT AIRLOCK

                  As Griff superintends preparations to open the lock door,
                  the men from the control room - Wendover, Kent and Sir
                  Ian, hasten in.  Now Griff cracks the hatch on the lock
                  door, and in a moment, Reef staggers out, then helps Carl
                  from the Explorer.  Wendover frowns, glances inside:

                                        WENDOVER
                            What about --- ?

                  Reef only shakes his head.  Faces are tense, then Reef
                  declares bitterly:

                                        REEF
                            We didn&#39;t kill it, Skipper.  And
                            if it ever gets...back where it
                            came from...the Earth is doomed,
                            and everything and everybody on it!


            319   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - TIGER SHARK AND SAUCER

                  And now, the mighty engines of the Shark succeed - the
                  bow of the Shark pulls out of the hull of the saucer,
                  and the two vehicles float freely in the water.


            320   INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM - DAY - GROUP SHOT

                  The scene JUMPS AND LURCHES.  Then there is an exultant
                  voice:

                                        VOICE
                                   (over intercom)
                            We&#39;ve pulled loose, Skipper!
                            We&#39;re free!

                  Wendover and Reef exchange an exultant look.  Then they
                  turn and run out toward the ladder to the con.  Kent,
                  Carl and Sir Ian follow more slowly.


            321   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

                  As Wendover and Reef come scrambling up the ladder and
                  through the hatch, the man at the helm indicates the TV
                  screen.  Wendover and Reef peer eagerly at it.  Wendover
                  smiles tightly.

            322   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OPTICAL SHOT - THE TV SCREEN

                  And we see the saucer floating loose in the water.  But,
                  suddenly, with a tremendous burst of speed, the saucer
                  moves away through the water, so rapidly as almost to
                  become a blur.

                                        REEF (o.s.)

                            There it goes!


            323   UP INTO FACES OF REEF AND WENDOVER

                  as Reef adjusts the dials of the screen, and Carl, Kent
                  and Sir Ian appear behind them.

                                        WENDOVER
                            Nothing we can do, now.

                            be one last, desperate chance -
                            a one-in-a-thousand shot...

                                        WENDOVER
                                   (desperately)

                            It&#39;s possible I could adapt one of

                            ICBM - so it would &#39;home&#39; on the
                            saucer when he rises from the Pole.

                                        WENDOVER

                  All we see is fields of ice and snow.  Finally the cross-

            331   (CONTINUED)

                  Reef nods, looks at TV screen.  Wendover moves to the
                  intercom, barks:

                                        WENDOVER
                            Prepare ICBM for firing!

                  Then he murmurs to Reef:

                                        WENDOVER
                            Well, that&#39;s all we can do --
                            until our space-friend decides
                            to blast-off.


            332   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK

                  And now, on the bow, we see the mighty ICBM lift from a
                  recess on the deck, in front of the conning tower.  It
                  stands on end in its cradle, ready.

                                                          WIPE TO:


            333   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - MED. TWO SHOT - REEF AND
                  WENDOVER

                  Reef&#39;s eyes on screen.  Wendover waits tensely.
                  Now Reef reacts.


            334   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OPTICAL SHOT - THROUGH SCREEN -
                  THE ICE

                  Suddenly, a phenomena like an undersea volcano rising.
                  The ice rends and cracks, rises in a great bulge.


            335   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE ICE

                  It breaks up, boils, tremendous rending, tearing NOISES.
                  Then, from the depths of the water below, a familiar oval
                  shape - smooth, glittering, beautiful - surmounted by the
                  gleaming cyclops eye appears.  The saucer rises from the
                  water like a great porpoise, hovers just above the ice,
                  then begins rising slowly into the air.


            336   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - REACTION SHOT - WENDOVER AND
                  REEF

                  as Reef exclaims excitedly:

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                                        114.


            336   (CONTINUED)

                                         REEF
                            Skipper - I think - it &lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt;!
                            It&#39;s Cyclops!

                  Wendover pushes him aside for a quick look himself.
                  Then, he leaps for the intercom, barks:

                                         WENDOVER
                            This is the Skipper!  Fire!
                            Fire!


            337   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK

                  Now we see a discharge like compressed air below the
                  ICBM.  It floats up and away from the Shark, in a ver-
                  tical position.  Then, straight as an arrow, it heads
                  for the surface.


            338   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE HOLE IN THE ICE

                  Now, from the black water, the ICBM leaps into-the air,
                  like a suddenly released, air-filled ball.  As it leaps
                  above the surface, the mighty rocket engines ignite with
                  a ROARING BLAST, and the ICBM leaps high into the air,
                  roars up o.s.


            339   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - WITH ICBM

                  It rises higher and higher, faster and faster, into the
                  sky.


            340   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER

                  It, too, is moving faster and faster, on what should
                  appear to be a converging course with the missile.


            341   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SKY

                  This is the &#39;money&#39; shot - to make or break the picture.
                  In one corner of the frame, the saucer rises swiftly.
                  But as it moves to center frame, in from the opposite
                  corner comes the ICBM, heading straight and true for the
                  saucer.  They meet.

                  The explosion is tremendous - a mighty, nuclear fireball,
                  great chunks of debris hurled sizzling into space in all
                  directions, a booming, pounding after-shock wave, then a
                  great sweeping mushroom cloud.  After this.....nothing
                  but empty sky.

           342    CUTS TO COVER - THE PHENOMENA ABOVE

           343    INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - REACTION SHOT - PANNING
                                               ALL THE PRINCIPALS

                  The shock, the exultation, the relief, then the
                  sagging easement of tension...it is beyond words.
                  Wendover looks at Kent, with a look more eloquent
                  than an hour speech.  Sir Ian&#39;s eyes are misty with
                  gratitude.  Carl begins trembling with reaction, and
                  Reef puts a comforting arm around him.  Griff sags
                  onto a stool, head down, just moving his head aimlessly
                  from side to side.  Reef and Wendover exchange a look
                  of silent understanding.

                                                     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

           344    EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT - LONG UP SHOT - THE NIGHT SKY
                    (STOCK)

                  on a moonless night, the stars glinting and sparkling
                  like billions of distant diamonds.

           345    SHOT - BOW OF SUBMARINE - SPECIAL EFFECTS SHOT

                  as it swishes through the water on the homeward voyage.

                                                           DISSOLVE:

           345-A  STOCK SHOT - NAVY YARD - NIGHT (as in 38A)

           346    EXT. NAVY YARD - NIGHT - TWO SHOT - REEF AND CARL

                  As they slowly walk away from the o.s. submarine towards
                  the gate.  Carl looks thoughtfully up at the sky as he
                  stops for a moment.

                                       CARL
                              They&#39;re so remote - cold - beautiful,
                              the stars.  But now - I wonder -

                                       REEF
                                     (smiling fondly)
                              Yes?

                                       CARL
                                     (whimsically)
                              Which is the one - we have to worry
                              about?

                  Reef also looks up at the sky thoughtfully, shakes
                  his head.

            346   (CONTINUED)

                                        REEF
                            Maybe - just &#39;maybe&#39; - when their
                            ship doesn&#39;t return - they&#39;ll
                            decide not to come here, after all.

                                        CARL
                            But if they &lt;u&gt;do&lt;/u&gt;?

                            I don&#39;t know.

                                        CARL
                                   (a slight smile)
                            I wouldn&#39;t worry.  So long as we
                            have boats like the Tiger Shark -
                            and people like you, the Skipper,
                            Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -

                                        REEF
                                   (smiles)
                            And his &#39;egghead&#39; son!
                                   (he punches Carl&#39;s
                                   arm jovially)
                            We&#39;ll give &#39;em a &lt;u&gt;rough&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;reception&lt;/u&gt;,
                            won&#39;t we?

                  They go out.

<h2>Web Scraping<a class="headerlink" href="#web-scraping" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Not all web pages will be as easy to scrape as these screenplay files, however. Let’s say we wanted to scrape the lyrics for Missy Elliott’s song “The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)” (1997) from <a class="reference external" href="http://Genius.com">Genius.com</a>.</p>
<img alt="../_images/Missy-Elliott.png" class="center" src="../_images/Missy-Elliott.png" />
<p>Even at a glance, we can tell that this <em>Genius</em> web page is a lot more complicated than the <em>Ghostbusters</em> page and that it contains a lot of information beyond the lyrics.</p>
<p>Sure enough, if we use our requests library again and try to grab the data for this web page, the underlying data is much more complicated, too.</p>

        &lt;p&gt;“The Rain” is as impressionistic as any lyric in rap; it sets a numinous mood. Furthermore,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=10542&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;this was Missy Elliott’s &lt;em&gt;first single&lt;/em&gt;, and it also spawned her first music video. Timbaland produced and co-wrote the song and appeared in the video (the beginning of Elliott’s longtime collaboration with director Hype Williams until he was replaced by Dave Meyers). Elliott played up her size in the video by wearing an enormous inflated trash bag – a “screw you” to all the execs who told her she was too fat to make it in the music business.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>How can we extract just the song lyrics from this messy soup of a document? Luckily there’s a Python library that can help us called BeautifulSoup, which parses HTML documents.</p>
<p>To understand BeautifulSoup and HTML, we’re going to briefly depart from our Missy Elliot lyrics challenge to consider a much simpler website. This toy website was made by the poet, programmer, and professor Allison Parrish explicitly for the purposes of teaching BeautifulSoup.</p>

<h3>HTML Tags<a class="headerlink" href="#html-tags" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>This is an HTML document. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language for writing web page documents.

<p>HTML tags often, but not always, require a “closing” tag. For example, the main header “Kittens and the TV Shows They Love” will be surrounded by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;h1&gt;</span></code> (opening tag) and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;/h1&gt;</span></code> (closing tag) on either side: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;h1&gt;Kittens</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">TV</span> <span class="pre">Shows</span> <span class="pre">They</span> <span class="pre">Love&lt;/h1&gt;</span></code></p>
</section>
<section id="html-attributes-classes-and-ids">
<h3>HTML Attributes, Classes, and IDs<a class="headerlink" href="#html-attributes-classes-and-ids" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>HTML elements sometimes come with even more information inside a tag. This will often be a keyword (like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">class</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">id</span></code>) followed by an equals sign <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">=</span></code> and a further descriptor such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;div</span> <span class="pre">class=&quot;kitten&quot;&gt;</span></code></p>
<p>We need to know about tags as well as attributes, classes, and IDs because this is how we’re going to extract specific HTML data with BeautifulSoup.</p>

<h2>Inspect HTML Elements with Browser<a class="headerlink" href="#inspect-html-elements-with-browser" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Most times if you’re looking to extract something from an HTML document, it’s best to use your “Inspect” capabilities in your web browser. You can hover over elements that you’re interested in and find that specific element in the HTML.</p>
<img alt="../_images/inspect.png" class="center" src="../_images/inspect.png" />
<p>For example, if we hover over the main header:</p>
<img alt="../_images/inspect-h1.png" class="center" src="../_images/inspect-h1.png" />

&lt;p&gt;“The Rain” is as impressionistic as any lyric in rap; it sets a numinous mood. Furthermore,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=10542&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;this was Missy Elliott’s &lt;em&gt;first single&lt;/em&gt;, and it also spawned her first music video. Timbaland produced and co-wrote the song and appeared in the video (the beginning of Elliott’s longtime collaboration with director Hype Williams until he was replaced by Dave Meyers). Elliott played up her size in the video by wearing an enormous inflated trash bag – a “screw you” to all the execs who told her she was too fat to make it in the music business.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[*Yawning*]
Run the track

[Chorus: Missy Elliott &amp; Ann Peebles]
Me I&#39;m super fly, super dupa fly
(I can&#39;t stand the rain) Supa dupa fly
Me I&#39;m super fly, (against my window) super dupa fly
(I can&#39;t stand the rain) supa dupa fly
Me I&#39;m super fly, (against my window) super dupa fly
(I can&#39;t stand the rain) supa dupa fly
Me I&#39;m super fly, (against my window)

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
When the rain hits my window
I take and *cough* me some indo
Me and Timbaland, ooh, we sang a jangle
We so tight that you get our styles tangled
Sway on dosie-do like you loco
Can we get kinky tonight?
Like Coko, so-so
You don&#39;t wanna play with my Yo-Yo
I smoke my hydro on the D-low (D-D-D-D-D-low)

[Hook: Ann Peebles]
I can&#39;t stand the rain against my window
I can&#39;t stand the rain against my window
I can&#39;t stand the rain against my window
I can&#39;t stand the rain against my window
I can&#39;t stand the rain

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
Beep, beep, who got the keys to the Jeep, vroom
I&#39;m driving to the beach
Top down, loud sounds, see my peeps
Give them pounds, now look who it be
It be me, me, me and Timothy
Look like it&#39;s &#39;bout to rain, what a shame
I got the Armor-All to shine up the stain
Oh, Missy, try to maintain
Icky-icky-icky-icky-icky-icky-icky

[Hook: Ann Peebles]
I can&#39;t stand the rain against my window
I can&#39;t stand the rain against my window
I can&#39;t stand the rain against my window
I can&#39;t stand the rain against my window
I can&#39;t stand the rain

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott &amp; Ann Peebles]
I feel the wind
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
9, 10
Begin, I sit on Hills like Lauryn
Until the rain starts coming down, pouring
Chill, I got my umbrella
My finger waves these days, they fall like Humpty
Chumpy, I break up with him before he dump me
To have me, (I can&#39;t stand the rain), yes, you lucky (against my window)

[Outro: Ann Peebles]
I can&#39;t stand the rain against my window
I can&#39;t stand the rain against my window
I can&#39;t stand the rain against my window
I can&#39;t stand the rain
I can&#39;t stand the rain
I can&#39;t stand the rain
I can&#39;t stand the rain
I can&#39;t stand the rain against my window
I can&#39;t stand the rain against my window
I I can&#39;t stand the rain against my window
I can&#39;t stand the rain against my window
I can&#39;t stand the rain
I can&#39;t stand the rain
I can&#39;t stand the rain
I can&#39;t stand the rain
